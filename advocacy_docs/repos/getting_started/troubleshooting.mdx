description: How to troubleshoot your repositories and downloads when they don't work
---

If your download doesn't work, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

* **Check your internet connection.** Make sure you're connected to the internet and that your connection is stable.

* **Check for errors in the terminal.** If the curl command responded with an error or returns immediately with no output, there may be an issue with the command. Check the command and try again.

* **Check for 404 errors.** If you see a 404 error, it's possible that your token doesn't entitle you to access the repository you've configured. Check the repository name and try again.

If none of these steps work, contact [EDB Support](https://www.enterprisedb.com/support-center) for assistance.
