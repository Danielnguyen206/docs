Head to [Getting Started](getting_started) if you want to start installing right away.

Efficient distribution and installation of software is key to a successful system deployment. At EDB, we create our software packages with this in mind and distribute it to you through platform-specific package managers. 

For most purposes, following the instructions from the download portal enables you to quickly configure your operating system to also download software from the EDB repository. After you've done this, your system can install any EDB package you need.
