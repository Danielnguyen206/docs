---

Use the following options when initializing a TDE-enables server with `initdb`.

## To enable TDE

To create a TDE-enabled database server, you must use the `--data-encryption` flag (short form: `-y`).

## To protect the data encryption key 

When creating a TDE-enabled database, TDE generates a data encryption key that is transparent to the user.

An additional protection mechanism in the form or a wrapping and an unwrapping command is required to wrap this key, which you must make available to the database server.

See [Providing the wrapping and unwrapping commands to TDE](secure_key//#providing-the-wrapping-and-unwrapping-commands-to-tde) for an overview of your options with examples.

## To use an existing data encryption key file 

You can use this option to copy a key from an existing cluster when preparing a new cluster as a target for pg_upgrade.

`--copy-key-from=<file>`

## Options reference

See [initdb TDE options](initdb_tde_options) for an overview of all available options and supported values.
