navTitle: "Version 1.0.0"
---

Released: 24 Apr 2024

This is the first major stable release of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes, a Kubernetes operator to deploy 
and manage EDB Postgres Distributed clusters.

## Highlights of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes 1.0.0

The operator implements the `PGDGroup` custom resource in the API group `pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io`. You can use this resource 
to create and manage EDB Postgres Distributed clusters inside Kubernetes with capabilities including:

* Deployment of EDB Postgres Distributed clusters with versions 5 and later.
* Additional self-healing capability on top of that of Postgres Distributed, such as recovery and restart of failed PGD nodes.
* Defined services that allow applications to connect to the write leader of each PGD group.

!!! Note
The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator leverages 
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/) (PG4K) and inherits many 
of that project's capabilities. EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes version 1.0.0 is based, specifically, on release 1.22 of PG4K. 
See the [PG4K release notes](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/rel_notes/) for more details.
