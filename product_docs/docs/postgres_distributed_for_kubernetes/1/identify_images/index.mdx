If you plan on deploying a specific version of Postgres Distributed or a specific Postgres distribution or version, you need to select the appropriate images and image versions.
Before [installing EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes](../installation_upgrade):

1.  Identify your repository name and retrieve your user token as explained in [EDB private image registries](private_registries).
1.  [Identify the image names for your environment](identify_image_name).
1.  [Assemble your deployment command](assemble_command).
