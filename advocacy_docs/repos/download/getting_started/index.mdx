You can get started with your repository using either of these approaches:

* [Use the web page](with_web) if you have an Enterprise subscription to EDB software and want to use the web interface to guide you through downloading and installing packages.

* [Use the CLI](with_cli) for any subscription if you want to use the CLI to install packages from EDB repositories. The CLI works for all EDB repositories and is the most flexible way to install packages.

!!! Note
 If you have a Standard or Community360 subscription or want to install packages for Postgres Distributed without using TPA, you must use the CLI. See [Getting started using repositories with the CLI](with_cli).
