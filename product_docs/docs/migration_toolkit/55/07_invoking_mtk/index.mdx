<div id="invoking_mtk" class="registered_link"></div>

After installing Migration Toolkit and specifying connection properties for the source and target databases in the [toolkit.properties file](../06_building_toolkit.properties_file), Migration Toolkit is ready to perform migrations.

The Migration Toolkit executable is named `runMTK.sh` on Linux systems and `runMTK.bat` on Windows systems. On a Linux system, the executable is located in:

`/usr/edb/migrationtoolkit/bin`

On Windows, the executable is located in:

`C:\Program Files\edb\mtk\bin`

See [Migration Toolkit command options](08_mtk_command_options) for information on controlling details of the migration.


!!! Note
    If the following error appears upon invoking the Migration Toolkit, check the file permissions of the `toolkit.properties` file.

```text
MTK-11015: The connection credentials file ../etc/toolkit.properties is
not secure and accessible to group/others users. This file contains
plain passwords and should be restricted to Migration Toolkit owner user
only.
```

The operating system user account running the Migration Toolkit must be the owner of the `toolkit.properties` file with a minimum of read permission on the file. In addition, there must be no permissions of any kind for group and other users. The following is an example of the recommended file permissions, where user enterprisedb is running the Migration Toolkit.

`-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 191 Aug 1 09:59 toolkit.properties`

## Importing character data with embedded binary zeros (NULL characters)

Migration Toolkit supports importing a column with a value of NULL. However, Migration Toolkit doesn't support importing NULL character values (embedded binary zeros 0x00) with the JDBC  connection protocol. If you're importing data that includes the NULL character, use the `-replaceNullChar` option to replace the NULL character with a single, non-NULL, replacement character.

!!! Note
    -   MTK implicitly replaces NULL characters with an empty string.
    -   The `-replaceNullChar` option doesn't work with the `-copyViaDBLinkOra` option.

Once the data is migrated, use a SQL statement to replace the character specified by `-replaceNullChar` with binary zeros.

## Migrating schemas

When migrating schemas from the source database specified in the `toolkit.properties` file, you have the following options:

- To migrate a single schema, specify the schema name.
- To migrate multiple schemas, provide a comma-delimited list of schema names.
- To migrate all the schemas, use `-allSchemas` from the source database.

|                  | On Linux                                                     | On Windows                                                    |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single schema    | `$ ./runMTK.sh <schema_name>`                                | `> .\runMTK.bat <schema_name>`                                |
| Multiple schemas | `$ ./runMTK.sh <schema_name1>,<schema_name2>,<schema_name3>` | `> .\runMTK.bat <schema_name1>,<schema_name2>,<schema_name3>` |
| All schemas      | `$ ./runMTK.sh -allSchemas`                                  | `> .\runMTK.bat -allSchemas`                                  |

### Migrating schemas from Oracle

Unless specified in the command line, Migration Toolkit expects the source database to be Oracle and the target database to be EDB Postgres Advanced Server. To migrate schemas, navigate to the executable and invoke the following command.

On Linux:

`$ ./runMTK.sh <schema_scope>`

On Windows:

`> .\runMTK.bat <schema_scope>`

Where `<schema_scope>` is the scope of schemas to migrate from the source database specified in the `toolkit.properties` file. You can include a single value to migrate one schema, a comma-delimited list of schema names, or you can use `-allSchemas` to migrate all the schemas from the source database.

!!!note Notes
   - When the default database user of a migrated schema is automatically migrated, the custom profile of the default database user is also migrated if a custom profile exists. A custom profile is a user-created profile. For example, custom profiles exclude Oracle profiles `DEFAULT` and `MONITORING_PROFILE`.
   - PostgreSQL default rows are limited to 8 KB in size. This means that each table row must fit into a single 8 KB block, Otherwise, an error occurs indicating, for example, that we can create a table with 1600 columns of INT and insert data for all the columns. However, we can't do the same with BIGINT columns because INT is stored as 4 bytes, but each BIGINT requires more space (8 bytes). For more information, see [PostgreSQL Limits](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/limits.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

### Migrating schemas from a non-Oracle source database

If you don't specify a source database type and a target database type, Postgres assumes the source database is Oracle and the target database is EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

To invoke Migration Toolkit, open a command window, navigate to the executable, and invoke the following command:

`$ ./runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype <source_type> -targetdbtype <target_type> [options, …] <schema_scope>;`

`-sourcedbtype <source_type>`

`<source_type>` specifies the server type of the source database. `<source_type>` isn't case sensitive. By default, `<source_type>` is oracle. `source_type` can be one of the following values:

| To migrate from:             | Specify:                   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Oracle                       | oracle (the default value) |
| MySQL                        | mysql                      |
| SQL Server                   | sqlserver                  |
| Sybase                       | sybase                     |
| PostgreSQL                   | postgres or postgresql     |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | enterprisedb               |

`-targetdbtype <target_type>`

`<target_type>` specifies the server type of the target database. `<target_type>` isn't case sensitive. By default, `<target_type>` is `enterprisedb`. `<target_type>` can be one of the following values:

| To migrate to:               | Specify:               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | enterprisedb           |
| PostgreSQL                   | postgres or postgresql |

`<schema_scope>`

`<schema_scope>` represents the schemas to migrate from the source database specified in the `toolkit.properties` file. You can include a single value to migrate one schema, a comma-delimited list of schema names, or you can use `-allSchemas` to migrate all the schemas from the source database.

The following example migrates a schema (table definitions and table content) named `HR` from a MySQL database on a Linux system to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server host. The command includes the `‑sourcedbtype` and `-targetdbtype` options.

On Linux, use the following command:

`$ ./runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype enterprisedb HR`

On Windows, use the following command:

`> .\runMTK.bat -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype enterprisedb HR`

The following example migrates multiple schemas (named HR and ACCTG) from a MySQL database to a PostgreSQL database.

On Linux, use the following command:

`$ ./runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype postgres HR,ACCTG`

On Windows, use the following command:

`> .\runMTK.bat -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype postgres HR,ACCTG`
