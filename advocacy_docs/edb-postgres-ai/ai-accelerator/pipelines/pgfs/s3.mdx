PGFS allows you to store and retrieve files from either a public or private S3-compatible bucket.

## Using pgfs through aidb




## Creating a server object

To connect to an S3-compatible storage location, you need to create a server object using the `CREATE SERVER` command. The server object is used to connect to the storage location.

The following example creates a server object for an S3-compatible storage location:

```sql
CREATE SERVER my_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER pgfs OPTIONS (server_type 's3', bucket 'my_bucket', endpoint 'my_endpoint', access_key_id 'my_access_key_id', secret_access_key 'my_secret_access_key');
```
