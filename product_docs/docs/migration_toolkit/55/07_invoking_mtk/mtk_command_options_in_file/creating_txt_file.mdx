To specify a text file that contains command line options and values, you must create a `<example.options>` file with the options you want to execute, and then run the `runMTK.sh` command with the `-optionsFile <example.options>` argument.

!!!note 
   You can store the `<example.options>` file in the same folder as the MTK utility, or in a directory of your choice.

## Creating the text file - guidelines

Create a text file on a location that is accessible by the user performing the migration. Then, add an option per line following these guidelines:

### Skip the dash 

Use the same option syntax as in the command line options without the dash sign (-). The options file recognizes each line as a new parameter and doesn't require a dash as a delimiter.

| Option in CLI  | Supported syntax for the option in file |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-tables hr`   | tables hr                               |

### Use a line per option

Use a new line for each option. Use a line per key-value pair. 

| Option in CLI                                                  | Supported syntax for the option in file                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-tables hr -allViews` <br/> `-excludeViews all_emp,acct_list` | tables hr <br/> allViews <br/> excludeViews all_emp,acct_list |
    
### Specify values for an option in a single or multiple lines

You can add multiple values for an option in a single line or in several lines. Both options are supported.

| Option in CLI       | Supported syntax for the option in file |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-tables TAB1,TAB2` | tables TAB1 <br/> tables TAB2           |
|                     | tables TAB1,TAB2                        |

!!!note 
   This syntax is only supported in the options file. <br/>
   When specifying tables using both `-tables` in the command line and _tables_ in the option file, some parameters from the CLI may get ignored. <br/>
   When using `-tables` in the command line more than one time, only the last parameter is executed. For example, `./runMTK.sh -tables TAB2 -tables TAB3` only includes the _TAB3_ table in the migration. 
!!!

### Use a space or equal sign to provide values

For options that require values (key-value pairs), separate the option from the value with a space or an equal sign (=). Both options are supported.

| Option in CLI    | Supported syntax for the option in file |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-views all_emp` | views=all_emp                           |
|                  | views all_emp                           |


## Other considerations

-   **Commenting out**: Use a pound sign (#) to comment out a line. MTK wonâ€™t execute that line.

-   **Limitations**: Do not use quote marks.

-   **Order of processing**: MTK reads command line options and option files in the order you provide them when running the command. 

    For example, if you run `/runMTK.sh -offlineMigration -optionsFile options.txt -safeMode <schema_name>`, MTK will first recognize the `-offlineMigration` option, then read the contents of `example.options` in order from top to bottom, and then read `-safeMode <schema_name>`.

-   **Order of processing**: If you want an option to be executed last, you can either put it at the end of the `example.options` file or use an options flag to run it last in the command line. For example: 

    ```
    runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile example.options -schemaOnly
    ```

    Or
    
    ```
    runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile example.options
    ```

    Where the content of the `example.options` file is: 

    ```
    tables=TAB1
    schemaOnly
    ```

-   **Space processing**: MTK removes spaces between an option and its value. When you separate an option from its value with a space, only one space is treated as a delimiter.

    For example, to run the `-views all_emp, mgmt_list, acct_list` command line option, you can add _views all_emp,mgmt_list,acct_list_ OR _views = all_emp,mgmt_list,acct_list_ in the options file. 


After you have created the options file, [execute the migration with the options file](executing_migration_with_txt).
