Once you've mastered the basics of securing your PostgreSQL database, it's time to dive deeper into intermediate topics. 
This guide covers intermediate security techniques that help further safeguard your data, improve auditability, and reduce risks associated with more sophisticated attacks.
By focusing on enhanced role management, encryption, fine-grained access control, auditing, and cloud-specific configurations, you can build a robust defense for your databases. 
Keep evolving your security posture by staying updated on emerging threats and security features in new PostgreSQL releases.

### 1. Advanced Role Management and Privileges
Effective management of roles and privileges is essential for maintaining a secure PostgreSQL environment.

- **Avoid Use of Superuser Roles**: Superuser privileges should be limited to only the most essential operations. Always create distinct, minimally privileged roles for day-to-day database tasks.

- **Custom Roles**: Create task-specific roles for finer privilege management.  Rather than using a single, all-encompassing role, create custom roles for different functions like read-only, read-write, and admin tasks. This limits the scope of potential security breaches.
```sql
CREATE ROLE read_only NOINHERIT;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO read_only;
```
- **Role Inheritance**: Use role inheritance to streamline privilege assignments and create hierarchies of roles that simplify privilege management. A parent role can be granted a specific set of privileges, which can then be inherited by child roles.
```sql
CREATE ROLE base_role;
CREATE ROLE admin_role INHERIT base_role;
```
- **Revoke Public Privileges**: Remove default permissions from the `public` role.  By default, new databases and tables grant certain privileges to the public role. It’s best practice to revoke these:
```sql
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE mydb FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

### 2. Fine-Grained Access Control with Row-Level Security
- **Enable Row-Level Security**:  Row-Level Security (RLS) provides fine-grained control over who can access specific rows in a table. This is essential when different users need access to different subsets of data. 
Enforce RLS policies on sensitive tables.  To activate RLS for a table, you first need to enable it:
```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

- **Define Security Policies**: Once RLS is enabled, you can create policies to specify which users can access or modify rows in the table.
```sql
CREATE POLICY employee_policy ON employees
FOR SELECT
USING (employee_id = current_user);
```

### 3. Database Encryption
Encryption is critical for protecting data at rest and in transit. Intermediate PostgreSQL setups often leverage encryption to secure sensitive information.

- **Encrypt Sensitive Columns**: Use `pgcrypto` to encrypt sensitive data at the column level.  While PostgreSQL doesn’t natively support column-level encryption, 
you can use client-side encryption libraries such as pgcrypto to encrypt and decrypt data. For example:
```sql
SELECT pgp_sym_encrypt('secret data', 'encryption key');
```
Ensure that encryption keys are stored securely outside the database, such as in AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, or other secure key management systems.

- **Full Disk Encryption**: If column-level encryption isn't feasible, full disk encryption should be used to secure the data directory. Encrypting the entire disk ensures that sensitive data is protected in the event of unauthorized physical access to the database server.


### 4. `pg_hba.conf` Advanced Configuration
The `pg_hba.conf` file controls access to PostgreSQL at the network level. Intermediate configurations involve more complex filtering and control mechanisms.

- **Granular Network Restrictions**: Configure specific IP ranges or hosts for different roles.  Define access based on user, database, or IP address to create fine-grained network policies. For example, restricting administrative access to a specific IP range:
```bash
host    all    postgres    10.0.0.0/8    scram-sha-256
```
- **Separate Roles by Network**: Allow different roles based on their origin IP.  You can create roles that have different levels of access based on their network of origin. For instance, read-only users on a public network, and read-write users on a private network:
```bash
host    all    read_only_user    0.0.0.0/0    scram-sha-256
host    all    read_write_user   10.0.0.0/8   scram-sha-256
```

### 5. Database Auditing and Logging
Auditing is essential for identifying abnormal behavior and unauthorized access. It also helps in compliance with security standards like PCI-DSS and GDPR.

- **Enable `pgaudit`**: Use the `pgaudit` extension for detailed logging of database activity.  The `pgaudit` extension provides detailed logging of SQL statements at various levels (DDL, DML, and more).  Install and configure it as follows:
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgaudit;
```

To configure pgaudit to log SELECT statements:
```bash
pgaudit.log = 'read'
```
- **Fine-Grained Logging**: Customize logging configurations to capture DDL, DML, and more.  PostgreSQL offers several levels of logging, but for performance reasons, you should fine-tune it.  
Enable specific logging for failed login attempts or DDL changes:
```bash
log_connections = on
log_disconnections = on
log_statement = 'ddl'
```
For more information on `pg_audit`, see the [pg_audit documentation](https://www.pgaudit.org).

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting
Intermediate PostgreSQL security requires robust monitoring and alerting. Several tools and configurations can help with this:

- **PostgreSQL Monitoring Tools**: Tools like pg_stat_statements, pgBadger, or third-party tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, provide insights into database activity and performance metrics.

- **CloudWatch for AWS Aurora**: For AWS Aurora PostgreSQL users, leverage CloudWatch to monitor database performance metrics and set up alarms for unusual patterns in CPU, memory, or I/O usage.

- **Set Alerts for Suspicious Activity**: Configure alerts for specific actions and abnormal behaviors, such as multiple failed login attempts, database role changes, or connections from unknown IP addresses.
```bash
log_min_error_statement = 'ERROR'
log_min_duration_statement = 1000
```

### 7. Database Hardening
Hardening your PostgreSQL server is an intermediate security practice that reduces the attack surface by removing or disabling unnecessary features.

- **Remove Unused Extensions**: Extensions can increase the attack surface of PostgreSQL. Disable or remove any extensions you do not actively use.  For example:
```sql
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS plperl;
```

- **Lock Down Data Directory**: Ensure that the PostgreSQL data directory is only accessible by the PostgreSQL user. Use file system permissions (chmod 700) to lock down access.
```bash
chmod 700 /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### 8. Securing PostgreSQL on Cloud Providers
Cloud environments introduce additional layers of complexity. The following can help secure your PostgreSQL instances in the cloud.

- **AWS RDS Encryption**:  Use AWS RDS's built-in encryption for data at rest with KMS-managed keys. This is easily enabled during the creation of an RDS instance.

- **Restrict Network Access**: Use cloud-level security groups or firewalls to restrict access to the PostgreSQL instance. Only allow trusted IPs or VPCs to connect to the database.

- **IAM Authentication**: Use AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access to PostgreSQL instances. IAM authentication provides an extra layer of security, reducing the need for password management.
```bash
aws rds generate-db-auth-token --hostname <endpoint> --port 5432 --region <region> --username <db-user>
```

### 9. Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Using MFA for database access further secures your system by requiring users to provide a second factor beyond just a password. You can integrate PostgreSQL with an external identity provider (IdP) that supports MFA.

- **External Identity Providers**: Integrate MFA with identity providers such as Okta, Google Identity, Azure AD, or AWS IAM for added security.
