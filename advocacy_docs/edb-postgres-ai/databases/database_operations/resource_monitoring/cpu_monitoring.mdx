CPU usage is essential for the processing of queries, connections, transactions and background processes. Therefore, it is important to ensure your CPU configuration can cover the requirements of your applications, and it has enough buffer to continue working through workload peeks.

## Healthy CPU 

As a general rule, a database server is considered to have a healthy CPU configuration when the average **CPU** usage is stable and does not surpass the allotted CPU resources. This ensures the database server isn't overburdened.

CPU usage mainly depends on the number and complexity of queries. Long-running queries, queries with multiple joins and aggregations are examples of complex and CPU-intensive queries. Other factors that affect CPU usage are the lack of indexes for easier scanning, high concurrency of queroes, background processing and others.

If you expect an increase of client read and write operations, observe how the usage increases over a period of time to determine when you will have to increase the CPU count.

If you don't expect an exponential increase of queries, and the in and out transactions are stable over longer period of times, CPU count isn't an immediate concern, but you should still monitor it regularly, since there are other factors why your CPU usage could be peaking, like overly complex queries. 

## Symptoms of CPU issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the CPU is running low are: 

- Slow response times 
- Connection issues
- Increased locking
- Other

## Checking your environment's CPU state 

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average value for **CPU**. If the average is persistently higher than 80%, consider revising your environment's configuration. 
    
## Solutions

You can always increase the CPU by [altering the instance size](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster. However, consider [checking other metrics](causes_solutions) first. Tweaking other configurations can help you improve database performance.
