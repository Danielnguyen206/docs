Check your environment's metrics.

## Connection metrics

Check for `max_connection` in relation with the current avergae of used connections.
Check for connections in idle state, which might be related with ...

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average for connections.
    If you see connections in an idle state, your `max_connections` limit could be too low. Alternatively, there could be problematic queries in lock state.  

If the requirements of your organizations' application or service have grown due to increased traffic, the solution is easy: increase the CPU by [altering the instance size](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster.
