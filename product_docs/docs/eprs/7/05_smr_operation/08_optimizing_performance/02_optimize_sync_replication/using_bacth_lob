title: "Using batch synchronization for LOB objects"
---

When synchronizing Large Objects or LOBs, by default, the Replication Server copies them row by row. This can make the synchronization process slow. 

To improve the performance of synchronization procedures, EDB supports copying LOBs in batches. This way, the Replication Server can copy several LOBs at the same time, making the synchronization of shadow tables faster. 

When enabling this option, the default number of parallel LOB copies is 100. Before enabling the batch mode, or increasing the number of simultaneous synchronization procedures for LOB objects, consider your resource availability, as batch procedures will increase memory consumption.
