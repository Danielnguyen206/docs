A healthy memory configuration is essential for caching, buffering and maintenance operations. Therefore, it is important to ensure your memory configuration can cover the requirements of your applications, and can handle workload peeks.

## Healthy memory configuration 

As a general rule, a database server is considered to have a healthy memory configuration when the average **Memory** usage is stable and does not surpass the 80% threshold of the allotted memory resources over a longer period of time. This ensures the database server isn't overburdened.

The key determining factor is the stability of caching, buffering and maintenance operations. If you expect an exponential increase of these operations, 80% could soon not be enough.

If you don't expect an exponential increase of caching, buffering and maintenance operations, 90% of used disk capacity is acceptable.

## Symptoms of memory issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the memory is not sufficient are:

- Slow response times 
- Frequen checkpoints, which consume more resources
- High CPU usage
- Connection issues
- Other

## Checking your environment's memory state 

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average value for **Memory**. If the average is higher than 80% for a longer period of time, consider revising your environment's configuration. 

## Solutions

You can always increase the memory by [altering the instance size](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster. However, consider [checking other metrics](causes_solutions) first. Tweaking other configurations can help you improve database performance.
