CPU usage is essential for the processing of queries, connections, transactions and background processes. Therefore, it is important to ensure your CPU configuration can cover the requirements of your applications, and it has enough buffer to continue working through workload peeks.

## Healthy CPU 

As a general rule, a database server is considered to have a healthy CPU configuration when the average **CPU** usage is stable and does not surpass the 80% threshold of the allotted CPU resources over a longer period of time. This ensures the database server isn't overburdened.

The key determining factor is the stability of client queries. If you expect an exponential increase of client read and write operations, 80% could soon not be enough.

If you don't expect an exponential increase of queries, and the in and out transactions are stable, 90% of used disk capacity is acceptable.

## Symptoms of CPU issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the CPU is running low are: 

- Slow response times 
- Connection issues
- Increased locking
- Other

## Checking your environment's CPU state 

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average value for **CPU**. If the average is persistently higher than 80%, consider revising your environment's configuration. 
    
## Solutions

You can always increase the CPU by [altering the instance size](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster. However, consider checking other metrics first. Tweaking other configurations can help you improve database performance.

- Processes consuming excessive CPU, for example, overly complex queries, or too many read and/or write operations from the client. 
- The maximum connections configured is too low, causing processes in idle state. Consider using connection pooling for workload concurrency.
