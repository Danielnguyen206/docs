title: "Using batch synchronization for LOB objects"
---

When synchronizing Large Objects or LOBs, by default the Replication Server copies them row by row. This can make the synchronization process slow. 

To improve the performance of synchronization procedures, EDB supports configuring the batch mode on LOBs. Configuring batch synchronization of LOBs allows the Replication Server to copy several LOBs at the same time, making the synchronization of shadow tables faster. 

When enabling this option, the default number of parallel LOB copies is 100. You can configure that number according to your replication needs and resource availability, since this will increase memory consumption.
