To reduce the number of command-line arguments needed when executing `pwr`, you can use a configuration file to specify options that always have the same value and whose values differ from the default.

!!! Note
`edb-lasso` requires a configuration file to be present to work properly. If it's not configured correctly, `pwr` will fail to complete. See the [Lasso documentation](/lasso/latest/configuration/) for more information on how to configure it.
!!!

## Configuration file locations

Postgres Workload Report looks for a configuration file in the following places and uses the first one found:

1. The file named in the `--config` command-line option, if given.
2. The file named in the `PWR_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable, if set.
3. `~/.pwr.conf`.
4. `/etc/pwr.conf`.

The installation package creates a template for the configuration file in `/etc/pwr.conf.templ`. We recommend copying this file to one of the
two places where Postgres Workload Report looks for a configuration file by default (`~/.pwr.conf` and `/etc/pwr.conf`), and editing the options in the template as necessary.

!!! Note
If no configuration file is found, Postgres Workload Report assumes the default value for all options, which you can still override using the corresponding command-line options. See [Using Postgres Workload Report](using/) for more on using command-line options.
!!!

!!! Note
Although the configuration file extension is `.conf`, its content must be in **valid** YAML format.

## Configuration file options

### `input_dir`

An existing directory where the `edb_wait_states` portion of a Lasso report is located. This option is used mainly for `pwr report` execution (see [Using Postgres Workload Report](using)).

### `output_dir`

Location of the directory where Postgres Workload Report writes report files. Executing `pwr` creates this directory if it doesn't exist.

### `report_name`

The name of the report files generated. Usually, you specify this option on the command line because different reports typically have different names.

Don't include a file extension. An appropriate extension is added based on the output formats specified on the command line (that is, `--pdf` adds `.pdf`, `--html` adds `.html`, and so on).

### `log_file`

The full path to the file where Postgres Workload Report writes the `stdout` and `stderr` logs.

### `log_level`

The logging level to use when running Postgres Workload Report. The following are valid values, listed from more verbose to less verbose: 

- `DEBUG`
- `INFO` (default if not specified)
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`
- `CRITICAL`

See [the Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels) documentation for more information about log levels.

### `log_format`

The format of the log messages that are written to the log file. See [the Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes) documentation for more information on log formatting.

### `assets_dir`

The directory containing the Jinja templates used to format the HTML output and the CSS used for PDF output. The default value is `/usr/share/pwr/assets`, which contains the assets provided with the `edb-pwr` package.
