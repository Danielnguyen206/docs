Healthy disk performance is important for the efficiency and reliability of databases. Disk performance determines the speed of read and write transactions, whether there is high or low latency and the I/O thoughput of concurrent operations. 

Therefore, it is important to ensure your disk can cover the requirements of your applications, and can handle workload peeks.

## Healthy disk performance  

One of the metrics that help you monitor disk performance is to observe the number of In and Out operations per second. A stable percentage of In and Out operations per second over the total volume capacity is a positive indicator for a healthy database cluster. This ensures that concurrent read and write operations can happen with no or very little latency.

It is important to consider the average number of read and write operations by monitoring I/O-related queries over longer periods of time, but also potential peaks as well as growing trends of read and write volume. 

If you expect an increase of read and write operations, consider increasing your instance size.

## Symptoms of disk performance issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the disk is performing badly are: 

- Slow response times
- High I/O wait times 
- Slow database operations like backup creation and maintenance tasks
- Other

## Checking your environment's disk performance state

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average percentage for **Disk IOPS** at the top of the page.
1.  See the number of read and write operations per second by scrolling down to a different view of **Disk IOPS** metrics.

## Solutions

You can always improve the disk performance by [altering the instance size](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster. However, consider [checking other metrics](causes_solutions) first. Tweaking other configurations can help you improve database performance.
