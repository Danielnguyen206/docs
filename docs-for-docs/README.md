# Docs for Docs

This is the documentation for the documenters who need to know how to write documentation for EDB products.

The Style Guide is a good place to start, but thats not here. That is currently in the advocacy_docs directory under community/contributing; this makes [the style guide available online](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/community/contributing/) along with the current guide on working with the repo and style guides for release notes.
