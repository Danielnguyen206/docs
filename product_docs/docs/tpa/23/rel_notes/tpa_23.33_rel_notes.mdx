New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.33 include the following:

| Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement | TPA now supports Debian 12 Bookworm on the ARM64 CPU architecture. |
| Enhancement | PGD version 5.5 allows for proxy nodes to be configured as read endpoints, which direct read-only queries to a shadow node. TPA supports this configuration option by setting a `read_listen_port` parameter under `default_pgd_proxy_options` and `pgd_proxy_options` in `config.yml`. This parameter is included by default when the PGD version is 5.5 or greater. Users can also specify the port numbers by passing `--proxy-listen-port` and `proxy-read-listen-port` arguments to the `tpaexec configure` command.  |
| Enhancement | TPA now supports deployment and configuration of the Beacon Agent on any Postgres node by assigning the role 'beacon-agent' or using the `--enable-beacon-agent` option with `configure`.  |
| Enhancement | Added support for `postgres_wal_dir` in Patroni deployments. When a custom `postgres_wal_dir` is specified in TPA configuration, TPA will make sure to relay that option to the corresponding settings in the Patroni configuration file. That way, if Patroni ever needs to rebuild a standby on its own, out of TPA, the standby will be properly set up with a custom WAL directory.  |
| Enhancement | When adding PgBouncer nodes in a Patroni cluster, TPA now configures Patroni with a `on_role_change` callback. That callback takes care of updating the primary connection info in the PgBouncer nodes in response to failover and switchover events. |
| Enhancement | EDB now produces its own `edb-patroni` package instead of rebuilding the `patroni` packages from PGDG. TPA now allows users to select between `patroni` and `edb-patroni` packages. The selection is made through the new TPA setting `patroni_package_flavour`. |
| Change | To work around broken Barman 3.10 packages in the PGDG repos, TPA now installs version 3.9 of Barman if using PGDG repos on an RHEL-family system. This behavior can be overridden by explicitly setting barman_package_version in config.yml . |
| Change | The `haproxy_bind_address` is now set to `0.0.0.0` when Patroni is the failover manager. This resolves an issue with the general default of `127.0.0.1` preventing communication between Postgres nodes and HA Proxy nodes. Users should change this value to something more restrictive and appropriate for their cluster networking.  |
| Change | Task selectors are now consistently applied in the final stage of deployment. Consistency of task selectors in the tests is improved and the examples of task selectors in the docs are now correct. All deploy-time hooks now have corresponding task selectors. |
| Change | If `barman_package_version` is set, TPA will now look at it when looking for the barman-cli package as well as for Barman itself. This resolves an inconsistency which caused clusters using the downloader to fail when `barman_package_version` was used. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby required permissions on functions in the BDR database were not being granted to the HARP DCS user on a witness node.  |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby docker provisioning failed with "read-only file system". On host systems running cgroup1 with docker containers running recent OS images, `tpaexec provision` could fail to provision containers with an error message like "mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/tpa.scope: read-only file system". TPA will now detect this case and avoid it.  |
| Bug Fix | TPA now provides a clear error message if the user runs `tpaexec cmd` or `tpaexec ping` before provision.  |
