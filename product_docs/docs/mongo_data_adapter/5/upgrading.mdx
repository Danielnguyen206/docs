If you have an existing installation of MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper that you installed using the EDB repository, you can update your repository configuration file and then upgrade MongoDB to a more recent product version. 

To perform the process, open a terminal window and enter the commands that apply to the operating system and package manager used for the installation:

To update your repository configuration file:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-repo
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |         Operating system         |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and Ubuntu                |

   
To upgrade to the latest product version, enter one of the following commands:

  |         Operating system         |                                  Upgrade command                                   |
  | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         | `sudo dnf upgrade edb-as<xx>-mongo_fdw`                              |
  | SLES                             | `sudo zypper upgrade edb-as<xx>-mongo_fdw`                              |
  | Debian and Ubuntu                | `sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install edb-as<xx>-mongo-fdw edb-libmongoc` |

Where

- `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system.

- `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number.
