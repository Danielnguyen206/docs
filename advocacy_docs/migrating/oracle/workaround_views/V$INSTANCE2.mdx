`V$INSTANCE` is a dynamic performance view in Oracle that provides information about the instance, 
such as the instance name, status, version, startup time, and host details. 
This view is essential for monitoring and managing the Oracle database instance.

PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server workarounds are available. 

## Migration considerations

When migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server,
you can map the `V$INSTANCE` view to a PostgreSQL view by aggregating information from various system catalog tables and functions. 
You can create a custom view to encapsulate these queries, that provides similar instance monitoring capabilities as Oracle.

## Migration example

### Oracle query example

In Oracle, you can run a query to get the instance details:

```sql
SELECT instance_name, status, version, startup_time, host_name FROM V$INSTANCE;
```

### PostgreSQL solution example

In PostgreSQL, similar information can be retrieved using system catalog tables and functions 
such as `pg_stat_activity`, `pg_control_checkpoint`,` version()`, and others. 

In Postgres, you can run a query to obtain similar information as with Oracle's `V$INSTANCE`: 

```sql 
CREATE VIEW v$instance AS
SELECT
    (SELECT datname FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE pid = pg_backend_pid()) AS instance_name,
    (SELECT state FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE pid = pg_backend_pid()) AS status,
    version() AS db_version,
    pg_postmaster_start_time() AS startup_time,
    inet_server_addr() AS host_name;
```

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server solution

EDB Postgres Advanced Server doesn't have a direct equivalent to Oracle's `V$INSTANCE`. 
Use PostgreSQL's system catalog tables and functions as presented in [PostgreSQL solution example]() to achieve similar functionality.
