title: "Creating a database cluster"
---

Before you migrate your database to EDB PostgresÂ® AI, create an empty database in a database cluster.
You will configure this database to be the target of your migration when using EDB Transporter.

1.  Access the [EDB Postgres AI Console](https://portal.biganimal.com) and log in with your EDB Postgres AI Database Cloud Service credentials.

1.  Select the project where you want to create the database cluster.

    See [Creating a project](/biganimal/latest/administering_cluster/projects/#creating-a-project) if you want to create one.

1.  Within your project, select **Create New** and **Database Cluser** to create an instance that will serve as target for the EDB Transporter migration.

    See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/release/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a single-node or a primary/standby high availability cluster.

    See [Creating a distributed high-availability cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/creating_a_dha_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a distributed high availibility cluster.

1.  In **Clusters** page, select your cluster, and use the **Quick Connect** option to access your instance from your terminal.

1.  Create a new empty database. For an example, see [Create a new database](/biganimal/latest/free_trial/quickstart/#create-a-new-database).
