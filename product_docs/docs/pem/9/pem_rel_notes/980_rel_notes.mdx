| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Added support for EDB Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Distributed, and PostgreSQL 17.                                                                       |
| Enhancement  | Added support for RHEL9 ARM64 platform.                                                                                                                   |
| Enhancement  | Added support to allow sslmode connections from PEM agent to PEM server.                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue for PEM port while registering the server. Now `pemworker` picks up the PEM port from the agent config file while registering the server.  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where PEM agent installation on Windows was failing if a `%` character was used to set the service for the agent.                          |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where some historical probe data was not purged because the system job that tracks data for purging would be erroneously deleted by another system job.                                                                                         |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue for displaying errors on EINTR signal. Now spoolers `select()` error will be displayed on EINTR signal only when log level is set to INFO. |
