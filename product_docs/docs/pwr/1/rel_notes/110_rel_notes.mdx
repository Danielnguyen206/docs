|       Type        |                                            Description                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature    | Added locking to PWR commands to avoid concurrent runs. |
| Change     | Changed the default value for the `assets_dir` config parameter to use the folder where packages place the assets  (`/usr/share/pwr/assets`). |
| Change     | Added the `--use-plain-report-name` option to the `execute` and `report` commands. This option bypasses the default behavior of appending the database name and report timestamp to the report name. |
| Change     | Reworked PWR output and logging. |
| Bug Fix    | Fixed RPM package to have a strict dependency on `edb-lasso` releases 4.13.0 and later. |
| Bug Fix    | Fixed PWR so it doesn't fail when `edb_wait_states` has no samples in the range. |
| Bug Fix    | Fixed issues when using timestamp without time zone. |
| Bug Fix    | Fixed issues related to configuration handling. |
| Bug Fix    | Fixed issue with `pwr report` failing if `--output-directory` doesn't exist. |
