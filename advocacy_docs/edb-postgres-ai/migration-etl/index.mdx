Moving your data to Postgres is a challenge that EDB Postgres AI is built to solve. The EDB Postgres AI platform includes a set of tools that help you migrate your data to Postgres and keep it up-to-date.

The available migration tools are suitable for different migration scenarios. The tool you use depends on the source database, the target database and the migration scenario.

## The EDB Data Migration Service

The [EDB Data Migration Service](data-migration-service) is a cloud-based service that helps you migrate your data to an [EDB Hosted Cloud Service](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/planning/choosing_your_deployment/edb_hosted_cloud_service/) database.

EDB DMS offers a secure and fault-tolerant way to migrate database data to the EDB Postgres AI platform using change data capture and event streaming technologies. This allows the migration to stream any changes in the source database to the EDB Cloud Service database.

At the end of an EDB DMS migration, you will host your database entirely within the EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service ecosystem.

## The EDB Postgres AI Migration Portal

The [EDB Postgres AI Migration Portal](/migration_portal/latest/) is a web-based tool that helps you assess and analyze Oracle database schemas and convert them to EDB Postgres Advanced or EDB Postgres Extended Server.

EDB PostgresÂ® AI Migration Portal offers an [AI copilot](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/) to assist users who are migrating their databases to EDB Postgres.

This tool is particularly helpful when converting complex schemas from an Oracle database to be compatible with Postgres syntax. It then allows you to migrate the schema to the target database.

## The EDB Postgres AI Replication Server

The [EDB Postgres Replication Server](/eprs/latest/) is an asynchronous replication tool that helps you keep your Postgres database up-to-date with changes from other databases.

You can use Replication Server to implement replication systems based on either of two different replication models: single-master (primary-to-secondary) replication or multi-master replication.

## The EDB Postgres AI Migration Toolkit

The [EDB Postgres Migration Toolkit](/migration_toolkit/latest/) is a set of tools that help you migrate database objects and data at a granular level from other databases to Postgres. The supported source databases include Oracle, MySQL, 
Microsoft SQL Server, and Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise.
