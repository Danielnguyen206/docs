description: Prepare for enabling TDE on your environment by reviwing the required steps
---

To enable TDE, you must initialize your database cluster with the data encryption option enabled. 

Regardless of whether you are initializing a new TDE cluster, or whether you want to enable TDE on an existing cluster, ensure you know the required steps and you have the information you need before you start.

1.  Choose a method to [secure the data encryption key](secure_key) generated by TDE.
    
    You can protect they key with a [passphrase](./secure_key/passphrase/), a wrapping key from a [key store](./secure_key/key_store/) or choose not protect the key for testing purposes. 

1.  Review the [initdb TDE options](initdb_tde_options) to ensure you have all information required for the initialization of a TDE-enabled database cluster.

1.  Review the [Limitations and TDE-specific options](limitations) to understand limitations and changes in the handling of PostgreSQL utilities when you enable TDE.

1.  Initialize a new cluster using TDE.

    - Export the wrapping and unwrapping commands to secure the encryption key. 

    - Initialize a database cluster with encryption enabled and other TDE options as required.

    - Start the database cluster.
