Common tasks that you may need to perform when working with EDB repositories include:

* [Directly browsing and downloading from repositories](directly) so you can see what is available and, when necessary, download packages directly without installing a repository.
* [Building local mirrors](building_local_mirrors) to speed up installations and reduce dependency on the EDB repositories.
* [Installing in an air-gapped environment](installing_airgapped) such as a secure location at a site where the systems running EDB packages can't access the internet.
* [Integrating with configuration management tools](integrating), including:
  * JFrog
  * Satellite
