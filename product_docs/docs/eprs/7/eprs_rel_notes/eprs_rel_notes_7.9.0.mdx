| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Ticket               |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Enhancement  | EDB Postgres Replication Server now supports batch replication for Oracle CLOB and BLOB types in Synchronize mode. This significantly reduces the time required to replicate a large number of row changes containing CLOB/BLOB type columns.                                                                              | #102185 <br/> #35513 |
| Enhancement  | The transaction commit timestamp from the origin node is now preserved when replicating to a target node. This is required to process the timestamp-based UPDATE conflicts when EDB Postgres Replication Server is used in a hybrid cluster where the EPRS Publication node is shared with EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD). |                      |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed a corner case issue where the synchronization from the target MMR node failed to resume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | #102604 <br/> #35539 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where some of the processed entries in the `rrep_tx_monitor` table were not cleaned up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                      |
