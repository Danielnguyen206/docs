CPU usage is essential for the processing of queries, connections, transactions and background processes. Therefore, it is important to ensure your CPU configuration can cover the requirements of your applications, and it has enough buffer to continue working through workload peeks.

## Healthy CPU 

A database server is considered to have a healthy CPU configuration when the average usage does not surpass the 75-80% threshold of the allotted CPU resources. 

## Symptoms of CPU issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the CPU is running low are: 

- Slow response times 
- Connection issues
- Increased locking
- Other

## Checking your environment's CPU state 

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average value for CPU.
    If the average is higher than 80%, consider [increasing the CPU count](#increasing-the-cpu-count). 

### Increasing the CPU count 

If the requirements of your organizations' application or service have grown due to increased traffic, the solution is easy. Allocate more CPU resources to your application by [modifying your cluster's **Instance type** in the configuration settings](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings).
