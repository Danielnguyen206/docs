Healthy disk performance is important for the efficiency and reliability of databases. Disk performance determines the speed of read and write transactions, whether there is high or low latency and the I/O thoughput of concurrent operations. 

Therefore, it is important to ensure your disk can cover the requirements of your applications, and can handle workload peeks.
## Healthy disk performance  

As a general rule, a database server is considered to have a healthy disk performance when the **Disk IOPS** value is stable and lower than 80% over a longer period of time. This ensures that concurrent read and write operations can happen at all times, and without latency.

The key determining factor is the stability of client queries. If you expect an exponential increase of client read and write operations, 80% could soon not be enough.

If you don't expect an exponential increase of queries, and the in and out transactions are stable, 90% of used disk capacity is acceptable.

## Symptoms of disk performance issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the disk is performing badly are: 

- Slow response times
- High I/O wait times 
- Slow database operations like backup creation and maintenance tasks
- Other

## Checking your environment's disk performance state

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average value for **Disk IOPS**. If the average is persistently higher than 80%, consider revising your environment's configuration. 

## Solutions

You can always improve the disk performance by [altering the IOPS or Input/Output Operations Per Second](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster. However, consider checking other metrics first. Tweaking other configurations can help you improve database performance.
