## Installing the extensions

There are three extensions that are required to use the AI Accelerator:

- `aidb` - The AI Database extension
- `pgfs` - The File System extension
- `vector` - The Vector extension

### Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have a PostgreSQL server running. You can install AI Accelerator on a Community PostgreSQL server, an EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or an EDB Postgres Extended server. Consult the installation guides for those products if you need help setting up a server. When you install the server, make a note of the package name used as it will be needed to install the AI Accelerator packages.

* For PostgreSQL, the package name is `postgresql-<version>`.
* For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the package name is `edb-as-<version>` followed by "-server".
* For EDB Postgres Extended, the package name is `edb-pge-<version>`followed by "-server".

If you have already got the server running, you should be able to determine the package name.

### Installing the packages

Once the server is running, there will be a number of packages that need to be installed. The packages are available in the EDB repository, and can be installed using the `apt` or `dnf` package managers depending on your operating system. The packages are:

* `postgresql-<version>-aidb` - The AI Database extension
* `postgresql-<version>-pgfs` - The File System extension
* `postgresql-<version>-vector` - The Vector extension

or for EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

* `edb-as-<version>-aidb` - The AI Database extension
* `edb-as-<version>-pgfs` - The File System extension
* `edb-as-<version>-vector` - The Vector extension

or for EDB Postgres Extended:

* `edb-pge-<version>-aidb` - The AI Database extension
* `edb-pge-<version>-pgfs` - The File System extension
* `edb-pge-<version>-vector` - The Vector extension

!!! Note Example
Installing the packages on Ubuntu 22.04, with EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 would look like this:

```shell
sudo apt-get install edb-as16-aidb edb-as16-pgfs edb-as16-vector
```
!!!

With the packages installed, you can now connect to the database and install the extensions.

### Install the AI Database extension

The AI Database extension is an extension that provides a set of functions to run AI/ML models in the database. The extension is installed using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

```sql
ebd=# CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
NOTICE:  installing required extension "vector"
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=#
```

### Install the File System extension

The File System extension is an extension that provides a set of functions to interact with the file system from within the database. The extension is installed using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

```sql
edb=# create extension pgfs;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

### Validate the installation

You can check the extensions have been installed by running the `\dx` command in `psql`.

```sql
edb=# \dx
__OUTPUT__
                                     List of installed extensions
       Name       | Version |   Schema   |                        Description
------------------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------
 aidb             | 1.0.1   | aidb       | aidb: makes it easy to build AI applications with postgres
 pgfs             | 1.0.2   | pgfs       | pgfs: enables access to filesystem-like storage locations
 vector           | 0.7.4   | public     | vector data type and ivfflat and hnsw access methods
```

Typically, there will be other extensions listed in this view. The `aidb`, `pgfs`, and `vector` extensions should be listed.
