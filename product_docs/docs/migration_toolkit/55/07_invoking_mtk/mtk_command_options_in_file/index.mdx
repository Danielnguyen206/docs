EDB supports using a text file to specify several [database migration options](../08_mtk_command_options.mdx) instead of manually entering them at the command line. This is particularly helpful when:

-   You have to specify a large number of command line options or a large number of values for complex migration scenarios. Entering all options or values at the command line becomes cumbersome, or you might reach command line length limits.

-   You want to apply the same migration options and values to several different databases, or you might want to automate database migration. Running `runMTK.sh` with several options and values repeatedly at the command line becomes prone to errors.

The `-optionsFile <options_textfile>` argument allows you to reference a text file with options and values, making the migration process easier. 

## Execute a migration using an options file

To perform a migration with a file that specifies the command options:

1. [Create a text file with the command options](creating_txt_file). 

1. [Perform a migration by invoking the file with the command options](executing_migration_with_txt).
