Oracle PL/SQL functions are very similar to Postgres.

With **EDB Postgres Advanced Server**, this similarity allows you to convert most schemas automatically with Migration Portal or with the help of AI Copilot. 

When the target Postgres distribution is **PostgreSQL**, **EDB Postgres Extended Server**, 
or when the Migration Portal isn't able to convert all PL/SQL functions, 
you have to convert the syntax manually. 

See some incompatible Oracle PL/SQL functions and how to convert them to Postgres manually.
