description: The available connection settings in LiveCompare 3.0

## Initial Connection

The initial connection is used only when `logical_replication_mode` is set to
`pglogical` or `bdr`. If you set data connections to use only the `node_name`
setting, it's used when the program starts to fetch DSN
from node names.

### `technology`
RDBMS technology. Currently the only possible value is `postgresql`.

### `dsn`
PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname`, and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).

### `host`
Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.

### `port`
Port. Default: `5432`.

### `dbname`
Database name. Default: `postgres`.
### `user`
Database user. Default: `postgres`.
### `application_name`
Application name. Can be used even if you set `dsn`
    instead of all other connection information. 
Default: `livecompare_initial`.

## Output Connection

The output connection specifies where LiveCompare creates the comparison
report tables.

### `technology`
RDBMS technology. Currently the only possible value is `postgresql`.

### `dsn`
PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname`, and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).

### `host`
Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.

### `port`
Port. Default: `5432`.

### `dbname`
Database name. Default: `postgres`.

### `user`
Database user. Default: `postgres`.

### `application_name`
Application name. Can be used even if you set `dsn`
    instead of all other connection information. 
Default: `livecompare_output`.

## Data Connection

A data connection is a connection section similar to `Initial Connection`
and `Output Connection`, but LiveCompare effectively fetches and compares
data on the data connections.

Similar to the `Initial Connection` and `Output Connection`, a data
connection is defined in a named section. The section name is of the
form `<Name> Connection`, with `<Name>` being any single-word string starting with an
alphabetic character. In this case, whatever you use as `Name` is called
the *connection ID* of the data connection. Each data
connection must also have a unique connection ID in the list of data connections.

If `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`, then you don't need
to specify any data connection. LiveCompare builds the
data connection list by fetching PGD metadata from the `Initial Connection`.

### `technology`
RDBMS technology. Currently possible values are `postgresql` or
    `oracle`.
### `node_name`
Name of the node in the cluster. Requires
    `logical_replication_mode` set to `pglogical` or `bdr` and also requires that
    the `Initial Connection` is filled. If `node_name` is set, then `dsn`, `host`,
    `port`, `dbname`, and `user` settings are all ignored.
### `dsn`
PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname`, and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).
### `host`
Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.
### `port`
Port. Default: `5432`.
### `dbname`
Database name. Default: `postgres`.
### `service`
Service name, used in Oracle connections. Default
`XE`.
### `user`
Database user. Default: `postgres`.

### `password`
Plain text password. We don't recommend using this. However, it might be required in some legacy connections.

### `application_name`
Application name. Can be used even if you set `dsn`
    or `node_name` instead of all other connection information. 
Default: `livecompare_<Connection ID>`.

### `start_query`
Arbitrary query that's executed each time a connection to a
    database is open.

### `fetch_fk_metadata`
Specifies whether LiveCompare gathers metadata about foreign keys
    on the connection. 
Default: `on`.
