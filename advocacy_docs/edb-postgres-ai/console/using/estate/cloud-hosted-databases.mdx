description: How to manage cloud-hosted databases in your EDB Postgres AI Estate.
---

Cloud-hosted databases are databases such as AWS S3 and RDS which are hosted in the cloud. The EDB Postgres AI Console allows you to manage these databases as part of your Estate, so you can see all your cloud-hosted databases in one place.

Cloud Hosted Databases currently displays all the AWS S3 buckets and RDS instances that are available in selected AWS accounts. 

## Managing Access to AWS

The **Manage Access** button first offers you a menu of projects you can manage the AWS access for. The console then takes you through the steps required to enable the Estate to collect this information from AWS. See [Integrating AWS](../../estate/integrating/integrate_aws.mdx) for more details. 

## Viewing Cloud-hosted Databases

Selecting any cloud-hosted database displays the last check-in time for the database, it's name and region.
