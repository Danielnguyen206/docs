This getting started describes how to use the CLI to download and install the EDB package you need. Using the CLI, you can install packages from any EDB repository, including `community360`, `standard`, `enterprise`, and `postgres_distributed`.

To install packages from EDB repositories using the CLI, you need to:

1. [Get your token](get_your_token).
1. [Add your repository](adding_edb_repositories).
1. [Install the package you need](install_named_package).

Once you've mastered package installation, you can move on to [working with repositories](../../working_with_repos). Learn how to directly browse repositories and download packages, create local mirrors, handle air-gapped installations, and integrate with configuration management tools.
