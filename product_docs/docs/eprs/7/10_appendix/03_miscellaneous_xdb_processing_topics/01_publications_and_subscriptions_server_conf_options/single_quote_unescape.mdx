title: "Unescaping single-quote characters"
---

In [Batch Update Using Prepared Statement (BUP)](/eprs/latest/05_smr_operation/08_optimizing_performance/02_optimize_sync_replication/01_using_sql_statements/) 
mode, Replication Server adds an extra single quote character (') when it recognizes text data with single quotes during the WAL-based replication.
This results in an additional single quote on the target database.

If there's a possibility that a source database table column contains a single quote character, 
and you don't want the target database to contain an additional single quote character, set the parameter `unescapeSingeQuote` to `true`.

By default, this option is disabled (`unescapeSingeQuote=false`).  

```
unescapeSingeQuote=true
```

When set to `true`, the option removes the single quote character that was added during the WAL-based replication operation in BUP mode.

!!!note Note
   Enabling the `unescapeSingeQuote` option adds extra processing for each column, which can increase the replication time.
   Therefore, enable this option only if there's a possibility that the source data contains single quotes and you configured Replication Server to use WAL-based replication in BUP mode.
