If you don't want key wrapping, for example for testing, then you must set the wrap and unwrap commands to the special value `-`.

This setting specifies to use the key from the file without further processing. This approach differs from not setting a wrap or unwrap command at all and from setting either/both to an empty string. Having no wrap or unwrap command set when transparent data encryption is used leaves your data encryption key unsecured and results in a fatal error when running an affected utility program.
