| Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement   | The M1 architecture now supports the following additional arguments to `tpaexec configure`:  `--location-names`, `--primary-location`, `--data-nodes-per-location`, `--witness-only-location`, and `--single-node-location`.  By combining these arguments, most common layouts can be specified without needing to edit `config.yml`.                                                                                 |
| Enhancement   | TPA now installs chrony during deploy, keeping the default config upon all except on AWS where we point to Amazon Time Sync service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Enhancement   | TPA now supports RHEL 8 and 9 on IBM Power (PPC64le).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement   | Added a `--force` option to `tpaexec relink`. By default, relink doesn't modify targeted files if they already exist. With `--force`, relink removes all existing targeted files then recreates them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement   | TPA now supports Debian 12 x86.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Enhancement   | `pg_failover_slots` is now a recognized extension                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Enhancement   | The `sql_profiler`, `edb_wait_states` and `query_advisor` extensions are now automatically included for any `pem-agent` node.  The list of default extensions for pem-agent nodes can be overridden by including a list of `pemagent_extensions` in `config.yml`.  If this list is empty, no extensions will be automatically included.                                                                                |
| Change        | TPA can now provision Docker clusters on hosts running cgroups 2 for all systems except RHEL 7. On newer systems (RHEL 9 or Ubuntu 22.04), TPA will use cgroups 2 scopes for additional isolation between the host and the containers.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Change        | Updated AWS AMI versions to the latest versions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed an issue whereby deploying to Debian 10 on AWS would fail with the message `The repository 'http://cdn-aws.deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports Release' does not have a Release file`. The backports repository for debian 10 (buster) is no longer available on deb.debian.org but the standard AWS AMI still refers to it, so we modify /etc/apt/sources.list accordingly before attempting apt operations. |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed an issue whereby deployment would fail on AWS when `assign_public_ip:no` was set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed problems with various roles that caused mixed errors when trying to use custom users for barman and postgres, thereby resulting in a failed deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed an issue whereby deployments after the initial one could fail with an error like `Unrecognised host=... in primary_conninfo` if the key `ip_address` was used to define the IP address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed an error whereby `tpaexec upgrade` could invoke the relink script in a way which caused an error and showed an unhelpful usage message for `tpaexec relink`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed an issue whereby a task to reload Postgres was skipped resulting in the restore_command override not being removed from `postgresql.auto.conf`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed an issue whereby TPA did not change to the source directory before attempting to compile BDR from source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Bug Fix       | Fixed an issue whereby TPA would require a valid 2ndQuadrant token even if one was not needed for the specified cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Documentation | Updated the tower/AAP documentation to include instructions on creating an AAP Execution Environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
