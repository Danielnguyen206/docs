A healthy memory configuration is essential for caching, buffering and maintenance operations. Therefore, it is important to ensure your memory configuration can cover the requirements of your applications, and can handle workload peeks.

Postgres databases can crash if memory runs outs. 

## Healthy memory configuration 

As a general rule, a database server is considered to have a healthy memory configuration when the average **Memory** usage is stable and does not surpass the allotted memory resources. This ensures the database server isn't overburdened.

Memory usage mainly depends on the complexity of queries and in-memory operations. A low setting for `shared_buffers`, large settings for `work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`, `max_connections`, an inefficient cache size and high number of active and idle connections are other examples of memory-intensive operations.

# The key determining factor is the stability of caching, buffering and maintenance operations. 

If you expect an increase of these operations, observe how the usage increases over a period of time to determine when you will have to increase memory.

If you don't expect an increase of caching, buffering and maintenance operations, and the metrics are stable over longer period of time, memory isn't an immediate concern, but you should still monitor it regularly, since there are other factors why your memory run out. 

## Symptoms of memory issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the memory is not sufficient are:

- Slow response times 
- Frequen checkpoints, which consume more resources
- High CPU usage
- Connection issues
- Other

## Checking your environment's memory state 

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average value for **Memory**. If the average is higher than 80% for a longer period of time, consider revising your environment's configuration. 

## Solutions

You can always increase the memory by [altering the instance size](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster. However, consider [checking other metrics](causes_solutions) first. Tweaking other configurations can help you improve database performance.
