| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Added support for Postgres `tablefunc` extension functions, such as `crosstab`, in user repairs of incompatible DDL objects. The `crosstab` function is commonly used as a workaround for the Oracle `PIVOT` operator, which isn't available in Postgres. |
| Enhancement  | Added a Migration Portal Knowledge Base entry that describes the use of the Postgres `tablefunc` extension `crosstab` function as a workaround for the Oracle `PIVOT` operator.                                                                           |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the issue that caused the Migration Portal to refresh when selecting the **Projects** tab after selecting the **Portal Wiki** tab.                                                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Improved the error handling capabilities of AI Copilot. It now provides better information about any errors returned from the backend server.                                                                                               |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the vertical scroll for AI Copilot so that it scrolls as new information is displayed.                                                                                                                                                |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the error that caused AI Copilot to lose in-progress streaming response when navigating to a different tab.                                                                                                                                   |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the error that caused the Quick Help section on the workspace page to go blank when navigating from the AI Copilot tab.                                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Improved AI Copilot to support adding line breaks in the AI Copilot text box using modifier keys (Control, Command, Option, Shift keys) along with Enter.                                                                                                 |
