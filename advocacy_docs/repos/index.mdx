Efficient distribution and installation of software is key to a successful system deployment. At EDB, we create our software packages with this in mind and distribute it to you through platform-specific package managers and download repositories or image registries and repositories.

## Download Repositories

If you are downloading EDB software to install on your system, you can use the EDB download repositories to download the software packages you need. Follow the guidance in [Download Repositories](download) or head to [Getting Started](getting_started) if you want to start installing right away.

For most purposes, following the instructions from the download portal enables you to quickly configure your operating system to also download software from the EDB repository. After you've done this, your system can install any EDB package you need.

## Image Registries

If you are looking for virtual machine images for Kubernetes, Docker, and other container platforms, you can download them from the EDB image registries. Follow the guidance in [Image Registries and Repositories](image) to get started.
