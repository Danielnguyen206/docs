description: How to access and download EDB software images for Kubernetes, Docker, and other containerized platforms.
---
There are two locations from which you can download EDB software for containerized platforms:

* The EDB private image registry 
* Public image registries

We recommend that you use the EDB private image registry to access the software. 

## The EDB private image registry

EDB software for containerized platforms is distributed as images. You can download these images from  EDB private image registry. To [access](access) this software, you will need an EDB Account to get the subscription token which is used as part of your access credentials. We recommend that you use the EDB private registry to access the software.

The private image registry includes operand images for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server and operators for Postgres and Postgres Distributed. It does not include Community PostgreSQL. That is available from the public registry `quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql`.

## Public image registries

Some software is also available from public registries such as quay.io. For example, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is available from the public registry `quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/cloud-native-postgresql`. From the public registry, this software requires a license key to use. For details on how to obtain a license key, see [License keys](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/license_keys/) in the Postgres for Kubernetes documentation.
