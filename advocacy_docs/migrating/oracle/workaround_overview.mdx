EBD offers several solutions for the sucessful migration of Oracle databases to Postgres. This guide offers practical aids, such as a collection of features (functions, views, queries, etc.) commonly used in Oracle accompanied by examples on how to adapt them to Postgres.

If you are migrating to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the Migration Portal and the AI Copilot may have already helped you convert most schemas. This section offers further reference material for the schemas that were not converted automatically. 

If you are migrating to PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Extended Server, this section offers reference material for you to convert schemas manually.

## Layout 

Each workaround contains the following sections: 

- Solution summary: a short overview of the solutions' complexity, availability and type. 
- Feature in Oracle: explains how the feature is used in Oracle with an example. 
- PostgreSQL solution: provides an example of how to adapt the function to PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Extended Server. 
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server solution: provides an example of how to adapt the function to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
- Migration considerations: provides further information to take into account when adapting the function.
