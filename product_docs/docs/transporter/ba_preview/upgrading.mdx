Upgrading the EDB Data Migration Reader is straightforward but involves a temporary halt to any data migration.
These components are designed to terminate and restart gracefully.

To upgrade the software:

1. Stop the EDB Data Migration Reader.

1. Install and start a new version of the EDB Data Migration Reader.

Data migration resumes.

Incompatible upgrades are documented in the [release notes](rel_notes) and can be identified by major version number increases.
