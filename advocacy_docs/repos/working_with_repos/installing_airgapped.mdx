description: How to install EDB packages in an air-gapped environment
---

For air-gapped installations, you need to download the packages and their dependencies from the EDB repository and then transfer them to the air-gapped environment. For details on how to download packages, see [Building local mirrors](building_local_mirrors), which shows how you can create a directory that contains all the packages and their dependencies that you need to install. 

It's the directory created by this process that you can then transfer to the air-gapped environment. In the air-gapped environment, you can then create a local repository and install the packages from there.
