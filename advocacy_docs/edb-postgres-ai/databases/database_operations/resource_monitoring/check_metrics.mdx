## Checking your environment's metrics

| Metric to check | What is a healthy margin?     | How do I check?                                                                       | Possible solutions         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Connections     | 80% of the maximum connection | Check `max_connections` and compare to average connections on EDB Postgres AI Console | Increase `max_connections` |
| Connections     | On idle connections           | Check EDB Postgres AI Console and connections in idle state                           | Configure connection pools |

### Connection metrics

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average for connections.
    If you see connections in an idle state, your `max_connections` limit could be too low. Alternatively, there could be problematic queries in lock state.
