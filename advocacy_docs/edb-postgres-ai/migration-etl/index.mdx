Moving your data to Postgres is a challenge that EDB Postgres AI is built to solve. The EDB Postgres AI platform includes a set of tools that help you migrate your data to Postgres and keep it up-to-date.

The available migration tools are suitable for different migration scenarios. The tool you use depends on the source database, the target database and the migration scenario.

## EDB Data Migration Service

[EDB Data Migration Service](data-migration-service) is a cloud-based service that helps you migrate your data to an [EDB Hosted Cloud Service](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/planning/choosing_your_deployment/edb_hosted_cloud_service/) database.

EDB DMS offers a secure and fault-tolerant way to migrate database data to the EDB Postgres AI platform using change data capture and event streaming technologies. This allows the migration to stream any changes in the source database to the EDB Cloud Service database until you decide to cut over.

At the end of an EDB DMS migration, you will host your database entirely within the EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service ecosystem.

- **Purpose:** Migration of database data

- **Applicable migration scenarios:** From Oracle, PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server to [EDB Hosted Cloud Service](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/planning/choosing_your_deployment/edb_hosted_cloud_service/) databases with PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server

## EDB Postgres AI Migration Portal

[EDB Postgres AI Migration Portal](/migration_portal/latest/) is a web-based tool that helps you assess and analyze Oracle database schemas and convert them to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

EDB PostgresÂ® AI Migration Portal offers an [AI copilot](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/) to assist users who are migrating their databases to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

- **Purpose:** Conversion and import of schemas

- **Applicable migration scenarios:** From Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server

## EDB Postgres AI Migration Toolkit

[EDB Postgres Migration Toolkit](/migration_toolkit/latest/) is a set of tools that help you migrate database objects and data at a granular level from non-EDB databases to EDB Postgres.

- **Purpose:** Migration of database objects and data, includes options for more granular control of the process.

- **Applicable migration scenarios:** From Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise or Postgresql to EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL.

## EDB Oracle Migration Handbook 

The Oracle Migration Handbook is not a tool or software, but a set of guidelines to help you through your migration journey.

The purpose of the [Migrantion Handbook](/migrating/oracle/) is to help you plan and execute an Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration. It identifies and describes the factors to consider when performing a migration, the steps in the migration journey, and the capabilities, tools, and services that EDB provides to help with migrations. It also covers the key similarities and differences between Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server and workarounds for known differences or incompatibilities.

- **Purpose:** Planning and walking you through a migration from Oracle.

- **Applicable migration scenarios:** From Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server

## EDB Postgres AI Replication Server

[EDB Postgres Replication Server](/eprs/latest/) is an asynchronous replication tool that helps you keep your Postgres database up-to-date with changes from other databases.

You can use Replication Server to implement replication systems based on either of two different replication models: single-master (primary-to-secondary) replication or multi-master replication.

- **Purpose:** Ongoing data synchronization

- **Applicable migration scenarios:** A number of combinations from and to Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server. See [Introduction](/eprs/latest/01_introduction/) for an overview of possible replication scenarios.
