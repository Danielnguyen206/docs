Oracle view syntax is very similar to Postgres.

With **EDB Postgres Advanced Server**, this similarity allows you to convert most schemas automatically with Migration Portal or with the help of AI Copilot. 

When the target Postgres distribution is **PostgreSQL**, **EDB Postgres Extended Server**, 
or when the Migration Portal isn't able to convert all view syntaxes, 
you have to convert the syntax manually. 

See some incompatible Oracle view syntaxes and how to convert them to Postgres manually.
