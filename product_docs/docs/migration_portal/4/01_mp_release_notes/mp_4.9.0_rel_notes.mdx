| Feature      | Added the AI Copilot feature that you can use to ask questions related to database migrations and request suggestions to resolve specific Oracle-to-EDB Postgres Advanced Server schema incompatibility issues. See the [Migration Portal AI Copilot documentation](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/) for more information. |
| Enhancement  | Added a repair handler ERH-2108 that removes the `PARALLEL/NOPARALLEL` clause from `PARTITIONED TABLE` and `MVIEW` definitions, as it isn't supported in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where Migration Portal couldn't remove the `XMLTYPE` column property clause from the `TABLE` definition. This clause isn't supported in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where an end portion of DDL files was removed due to a parsing failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
