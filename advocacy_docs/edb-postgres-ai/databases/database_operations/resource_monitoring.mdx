When running Postgres in an operational environment, it's crucial to monitor various system and database metrics to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and availability. 

EDB offers several methods that allow you to monitor your databases. The available monitoring methods depend on your environment. In the EDB PostgresÂ® AI landscape for example, you can monitor your databases with the [Observability](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_using_biganimal_observability/) and [Health Status](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/health_status/) options, or directly with your cloud provider, for example, by looking at the [AWS metrics and logs](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_from_aws/).

To cover the basics, ensure you monitor the following metrics: 

- [CPU]()
- [Memory]()
- [Disk performance]()
- [Disk storage]()

[A more general way of monitoring your resources without requiring access to the Console or other database management systems is to query the state of your hardware and your databases with SQL queries. Regardless of the environment or Postgres distribution you have, you will be able to monitor metrics with SQL statements. This section provides an overview of SQL statement you can use to query the current state of your resources.]: #
