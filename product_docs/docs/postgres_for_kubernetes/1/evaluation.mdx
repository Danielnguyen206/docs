EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is available for a free evaluation.

The process is different between Community PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

## Evaluating using PostgreSQL

By default, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes installs the latest available version of Community PostgreSQL.

No license key is required. The operator automatically generates an implicit trial license for the cluster that lasts for 30 days. This trial license is ideal for evaluation, proof of concept, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and so on.

PostgreSQL container images are available at [quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql](https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/postgresql).

## Evaluating using EDB Postgres Advanced Server

There are two ways to obtain the EDB Postgres Advanced Server image for evaluation purposes. The easiest is through the EDB Image Repository, where all you’ll need is an EDB account to auto generate a repository access token. The other way is to download the image through [quay.io](http://quay.io) and request a trial license key from EDB support.

### EDB Image Repository

You can use EDB Postgres for Kubernetes with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. You can access the image by obtaining a repository access token to EDB's image repositories.

### Obtaining your access token

You can request a repository access token from the [EDB Repositories Download](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) page. You will also need to be signed into your EDB account. If you don't have an EDB Account, you can [register for one](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) on the EDB site.

### Quay Image Repository

If you want to use the Quay image repository, you’ll need a trial license key for access to use the images. To request a trial license key for EDB Postgres Kubernetes please contact your sales representative or you can contact our EDB Technical Support Team by email at [techsupport@enterprisedb.com](mailto:techsupport@enterprisedb.com) or file a ticket on our support portal <https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com>. Please allow 24 hours for your license to be generated and delivered to you and if you need any additional support please do not hesitate to contact us.

Once you have your license key, EDB Postgres Advanced container images will be available at <https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced> 

You can then use EDB Postgres Advanced Server by setting in the `spec` section of the `Cluster` deployment configuration file:

-   `imageName` to point to the quay.io/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced repository  
-   `licenseKey` to your license key (in the form of a string)

To see how `imageName` and `licenseKey` is set, refer to the [cluster-full-example](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/samples/cluster-example-full.yaml) file from the [configuration samples](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/samples/) section.
