Whether you're starting out with basic security controls or aiming to meet strict regulatory requirements like STIGs, PCI-DSS, GDPR, or FISMA, PostgreSQL offers the flexibility and power to protect your data. Regular audits, logging, encryption, and role management are essential components of a secure PostgreSQL environment.
