| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby running deploy after a switchover fails for nodes with `efm-witness` role. The `upstream-primary` for EFM nodes is determined using the facts gathered from Postgres. This previously failed for nodes with `efm-witness` roles  since they do not have Postgres. The task to determine upstream-primary is now run only on nodes with `primary` or `replica` roles.  |
