Access to EDB's private image registries and repositories is managed using a subscription token. This token enables you to configure your container platform to access the EDB image registries and repositories.

## Getting your token

To get your subscription token, use the web interface to the EDB repositories. This is the only place where tokens are issued. After you have your token, use the CLI to continue your work. 

1. Go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://edbpostgres.com/repos-downloads) page.

  If you're not logged in, log in to your EDB account to access this page. After you log in, go to the Account Profile page. On the Account Profile page, select **Repo Access**.

1.  On the EDB Repositories page, if it's your first visit, select **Request Access** on the Repos 2.0 page to generate your subscription token. If not, your token is displayed (but obscured) on the page.

1. To copy the token to the clipboard, select the **Copy Token** icon. Then store the token safely.

## Selecting your registry

There are two repositories available within the EDB private registry; 

Depending on your subscription plan,  "EDB Enterprise Plan" or "EDB Standard Plan",  EDB Postgres for Kubernetes will be in one of the following repositories, as described in the table below:

| Plan                | Repository       |
|---------------------|------------------|
| EDB Standard Plan   | `k8s_standard`   |
| EDB Enterprise Plan | `k8s_enterprise` |

The repository name is used as a username for accessing the registry. The subscription token is used as the password.

You can use the following command to log in to the registry:

```shell
docker login docker.enterprisedb.com
```

## Creating a pull secret

To enable your platform to access the EDB image repositories, you need to create a pull secret. This secret is used to authenticate your platform to the EDB private registry and is stored within the platform's namespace.

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-pullsecret \
  -n <CLUSTER-NAMESPACE> --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
  --docker-username=<REGISTRY-NAME> \
  --docker-password=<TOKEN>
```

Replace `<CLUSTER-NAMESPACE>` with the namespace where you want to store the secret, `<REGISTRY-NAME>` with the repository name, and `<TOKEN>` with the subscription token.

This will create a secret named `registry-pullsecret` in the specified namespace.
