To specify a text file that contains command line options and values, create an `<options_textfile>` file with the options you want to execute. Then run the `runMTK.sh` command with the `-optionsFile <options_textfile>` argument.

!!!note
   You can store the `<options_textfile>` file in the same folder as the Migration Toolkit utility or in a directory of your choice.

## Creating the text file - guidelines

Create a text file in a location that's accessible by the user performing the migration. Then, add one option per line following these guidelines.

### Skip the dash

Use the same option syntax as in the command line options without the dash (-). The options file recognizes each line as a new parameter and doesn't require a dash as a delimiter.

| Option in CLI  | Supported syntax for the option in file |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-tables hr`   | tables hr                               |

### Use a line per option

Use a new line for each option. Use one line per key-value pair.

| Option in CLI                                                  | Supported syntax for the option in file                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-tables hr -allViews` <br/> `-excludeViews all_emp,acct_list` | tables hr <br/> allViews <br/> excludeViews all_emp,acct_list |

### Specify values for an option in a single line or multiple lines

You can add a single line with an option and multiple values for that option.

You can add several lines for the same option, each time with a different value.

And you can combine both approaches, because Migration Toolkit combines all lines that specify the same option.

| Option in CLI            | Supported syntax for the option in file         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `-tables TAB1,TAB2,TAB3` | tables TAB1 <br/> tables TAB2 <br/> tables TAB3 |
|                          | tables TAB1,TAB2,TAB3                           |
|                          | tables TAB1 <br/> tables TAB2,TAB3              |

!!!note
   Duplicating options is supported only for the options file. <br/>
   When using `-tables` at the command line more than one time, only the last parameter is executed. For example, `./runMTK.sh -tables TAB2 -tables TAB3` includes only the `TAB3` table in the migration.
!!!

### Use a space or equal sign to provide values

For options that require values (key-value pairs), separate the option from the value with a space or an equal sign (=). Both syntaxes are supported.

| Option in CLI    | Supported syntax for the option in file |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-views all_emp` | views=all_emp                           |
|                  | views all_emp                           |

### Don't specify an option in the file and at the command line

Don't include an option in the options file if you're specifying it as a flag at the command line.

Specifying an option both at the command line and in the text file causes the migration to fail.

## Order of processing

Migration Toolkit reads command line options and option files in the order you provide them when running the command. Ensure you add the [schema scope](../../07_invoking_mtk/#migrating-schemas) as the last parameter at the command line.

For example, if you run the following command, Migration Toolkit first recognizes the `-sourcedbtype oracle` option, and then reads the contents of `options_textfile` in order from top to bottom. The last parameter is the `<schema_scope>`.

```shell
runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile options_textfile <schema_scope>
```

Using an options file means that you can employ different syntaxes to perform a migration where parameters are executed in the same way. The following alternatives perform the same migration.

**Alternative 1**

```shell
runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile <options_textfile> <schema_scope>
```

Where the content of the `<options_textfile>` file is:

```
tables=TAB1
dataOnly
```

**Alternative 2**

```shell
runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile <options_textfile> -dataOnly <schema_scope>
```

Where the content of the `<options_textfile>` file is:

```
tables=TAB1
```

## Other considerations

-   **Commenting out** &mdash; Use a pound sign (#) to comment out a line. Migration Toolkit doesn't execute lines that are commented out.

-   **Limitations** &mdash; Don't use quote marks.

-   **Space processing** &mdash; Migration Toolkit removes spaces between an option and its value. When you separate an option from its value with a space, only one space is treated as a delimiter.

    For example, to run the `-views all_emp, mgmt_list, acct_list` command line option, you can add `views all_emp,mgmt_list,acct_list` or `views = all_emp,mgmt_list,acct_list` in the options file.

After you create the options file, [execute the migration with it](executing_migration_with_txt).
