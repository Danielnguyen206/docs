EBD offers several solutions for the sucessful migration of Oracle databases to Postgres. This handbook offers practical aids, such as a collection of features (functions, views, queries, etc.) commonly used in Oracle accompanied by examples on how to adapt them to Postgres.

If you are migrating to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the Migration Portal and the AI Copilot may have already helped you convert most schemas. This section offers further reference material for the schemas that were not converted automatically. 

If you are migrating to PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Extended Server, this section offers reference material for you to convert schemas manually.

| [Pinelined function](pipelined_functionsB)       | Allows a PL/SQL function to return a set of rows as a table, which can be queried like a regular table.                                                                  |
