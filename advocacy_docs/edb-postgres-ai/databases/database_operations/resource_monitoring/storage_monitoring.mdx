Sufficient disk storage is important to ensure a database's performance, reliability, durability. The storage capacity of a disk determines whether there is enough volume to store all data, and whether the system can perform other maintenance-related operations like backup and recovery. 

Free capacity is important to ensure operations can continue running.

Therefore, it is important to ensure your disk can cover the requirements of your databases, and has enough capacity to support a growing environment. 

## Healthy disk storage capacity

As a general rule, a database server is considered to have sufficient disk capacity when the **Storage** value is stable and lower than 80% over a longer period of time.

The key determining factor is the data stability of your databases. If you expect an exponential increase of the data stored in the database, 80% could still exhaust soon. 

If you don't expect exponential data increases and the data set is stable, 90% of used disk capacity is acceptable.

## Symptoms of disk storage issues 

Some symptoms that you could encounter when the storage is running low are: 

- Log and error messages for writ operations 
- Slow response times and unresponsiveness
- High I/O wait times 
- Failed database operations like backup creation and maintenance tasks
- Other

## Checking your environment's disk capacity state

On the EDB Postgres AI Console: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select **Monitoring & Logging** tab.
1.  Use the **Start date** and **End date** to display the average values for a period of time. Start by looking at the first month, then the last three months, the last six months and the last year. 
1.  For each selected period of time, look at the average value for **Storage**. If the average is persistently higher than 80%, consider revising your environment's configuration. 

Altenatively, you can view the **Storage** state per node: 

1.  Select a **Project**. 
1.  Select **Clusters**. If there is more than one cluster, select the cluster for which you want to see the metrics. 
1.  Select the **Health Status** tab.
1.  Look at the average value for **Storage** per node. If the average is persistently higher than 80%, consider revising your environment's configuration. 

## Solutions

You can always improve the storage capacity by [increasing the volume size](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings) for a database cluster. However, consider [checking other metrics](causes_solutions) first. Tweaking other configurations can help you improve database performance.
