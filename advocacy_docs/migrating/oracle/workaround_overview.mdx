EDB provides a version of Postgres that is compatible with most of the built-in Oracle features. This greatly simplifies migrations from Oracle by allowing many objects and application queries to work in Postgres without having to modify them. 
Additionally, EBD offers several migration tools (Migration Portal, AI Copilot, Migration Toolkit, Replication Server) that facilitate the migration of complex Oracle databases to EDB Postgres. 

For the remaining incompatibilities, EDB offers this workaround guide with practical aids for features and issues that could not be resolved automatically. It presents a collection of manual solutions to convert features and queries accompanied by examples on how to address them.

Each workaround displays a table that contains a summary of the solution's most important things to consider. 

## Solution complexity 

Specifies the complexity and level of effort to address the issue.

- **Easy:** 
  These workarounds require minimal effort and are easy to implement. The compatibility with EDB Postgres is very high and the solution involves simple modifications. Performing tests to validate the solution is recommended.

- **Moderate:** 
  These issues are still easily manageable and don't require a lot of backgroung knowledge. The compatibility with EDB Postgres is high and the solution involves modifications. Performing tests to validate the solution is recommended.

- **Intermediate:** 
  The solution may require an understanding of the Oracle database. You may need to perform troubleshooting efforts and performing comprehensive tests to validate the solution is recommended.

- **Significant:** 
  Finding an equivalent for these functions requires effort, planning and a deeper understanding of Oracle and Postgres databases. The solution may involve extensive modifications like using a combination of functions to reflect the original function. You will need to perform comprehensive troubleshooting efforts and end-to-end testing to validate the equivalent. 

- **Difficult:** 
  Finding an equivalent for these functions requires effort, planning and a deeper understanding of Oracle and Postgres databases. The solution will involve extensive modifications like using a combination of functions to reflect the original function. You will need to perform comprehensive troubleshooting efforts and end-to-end testing to validate the equivalent. 
   

## Availability 

Specifies the EDB Postgres distributions where the solution is available.

- Yes, fully convertible to EDB Postgres and EDB Postgres Advanced Server
- No, partially convertible or no available equivalent. 

[Are there possibly solutions that will only apply to EPAS and not to PG? Do we need a category for that?]#
