EDB supports using a text file to specify several [database migration options](../08_mtk_command_options.mdx) instead of manually entering them in the command line. This is particularly helpful when:

-   You have to specify a large number of command line options for complex migration scenarios. Entering all options in the command line becomes troublesome, or you might have even reached command line length limits.

-   You have to specify a large number of values for a command line option for complex migration scenarios. Entering all values in the command line becomes troublesome, or you might have even reached command line length limits.

-   You want to apply the same migration options and values to several different databases, or you might even consider automating the migration of databases. Running `runMTK.sh` with several options and values repeatedly in the command line becomes prone to errors. 

The `-optionsFile <example.options>` argument allows you to reference a text file with all options and values, making the migration process easier. 

## Execute a migration using an options file

To perform a migration with a file that specifies the command options:

1. [Create a text file with the command options](creating_txt_file). 

1. [Perform a migration by invoking the file with the command options](executing_migration_with_txt).
