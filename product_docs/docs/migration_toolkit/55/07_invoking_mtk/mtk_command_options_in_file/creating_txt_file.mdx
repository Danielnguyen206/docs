To specify a text file that contains command line options and values, you must create a `<example.options>` file with the options you want to execute, and then run the `runMTK.sh` command with the `-optionsFile <example.options>` argument.

!!!note
   You can store the `<example.options>` file in the same folder as the MTK utility, or in a directory of your choice.

## Creating the text file - guidelines

Create a text file on a location that is accessible by the user performing the migration. Then, add an option per line following these guidelines:

### Skip the dash

Use the same option syntax as in the command line options without the dash sign (-). The options file recognizes each line as a new parameter and doesn't require a dash as a delimiter.

| Option in CLI  | Supported syntax for the option in file |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-tables hr`   | tables hr                               |

### Use a line per option

Use a new line for each option. Use a line per key-value pair.

| Option in CLI                                                  | Supported syntax for the option in file                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-tables hr -allViews` <br/> `-excludeViews all_emp,acct_list` | tables hr <br/> allViews <br/> excludeViews all_emp,acct_list |

### Specify values for an option in a single or multiple lines

You can add a single line with an option and multiple values for that option.

You can add several lines for the same option, each time with a different value.

And you can combine both approaches, because MTK will combine all lines that have the same option.

| Option in CLI            | Supported syntax for the option in file         |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `-tables TAB1,TAB2,TAB3` | tables TAB1 <br/> tables TAB2 <br/> tables TAB3 |
|                          | tables TAB1,TAB2,TAB3                           |
|                          | tables TAB1 <br/> tables TAB2,TAB3              |

!!!note
   The duplication of options is only supported for the options file. <br/>
   When using `-tables` in the command line more than one time, only the last parameter is executed. For example, `./runMTK.sh -tables TAB2 -tables TAB3` only includes the _TAB3_ table in the migration.
!!!

### Use a space or equal sign to provide values

For options that require values (key-value pairs), separate the option from the value with a space or an equal sign (=). Both options are supported.

| Option in CLI    | Supported syntax for the option in file |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `-views all_emp` | views=all_emp                           |
|                  | views all_emp                           |

### Don't specify an option in the file and command line

Don't include an option in the options file if you're specifying it as a flag in the command line.

Specifying an option in both the command line and in the text file will cause the migration to fail.

## Order of processing

Migration Toolkit reads command line options and option files in the order you provide them when running the command.

For example, if you run the following command, MTK first recognizes the `-sourcedbtype oracle` option, then reads the contents of `example.options` in order from top to bottom. Last parameter is always `schema_name`.

```shell
runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile example.options schema_name
```

If you want an option to be executed last, you can either put it at the end of the `example.options` file and add no further options after `-optionsFile` in the command line.

Schema definition (`schema_name` or `-allSchemas`) must always be the last parameter on the command line.

```shell
runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile example.options schema_name
```

Where the content of the `example.options` file is:

```
tables=TAB1
dataOnly
]```

Or you can place the options flag (-dataOnly in this case) in the command line after specifying the `-optionsFile`:

```shell
runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype oracle -optionsFile example.options -dataOnly schema_name
```

## Other considerations

-   **Commenting out**: Use a pound sign (#) to comment out a line. MTK wonâ€™t execute that line.

-   **Limitations**: Do not use quote marks.

-   **Space processing**: MTK removes spaces between an option and its value. When you separate an option from its value with a space, only one space is treated as a delimiter.

    For example, to run the `-views all_emp, mgmt_list, acct_list` command line option, you can add _views all_emp,mgmt_list,acct_list_ OR _views = all_emp,mgmt_list,acct_list_ in the options file.

After you have created the options file, [execute the migration with the options file](executing_migration_with_txt).
