You can browse a repository to locate your package, download a package from a repository, and download an entire repository available in your current view.

## Browsing to locate your package

1. Go to [https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads). 

  If you're not already logged in, log in to your EDB account. Go to the Account Profile page. On the Account Profile page, select **Repo Access**.

1. Select **Access Repos 2.0**.

    You're now viewing the **EDB Repositories for Linux** page, which has  two sections: **Install EDB software** and **Download EDB software**. In the **Download** section, below the title is a panel listing the repositories available to browse.

The view of the available files shows as multiple pages, with the current page and count of pages. To view all the results in a single page, select the up/down arrow toggle next to the **Search** field. 

To filter the results to include only package names that contain the search text, enter text in the search field.

## Downloading your package

For any available package shown, a download icon displays at the right side of the package list. Select it this to download the package. The package downloads with the full name as displayed in the name column of the list.

## Downloading the archive

If you want to download the entire repository available in your current view, select **Download Archive** at the top of the page. This downloads a compressed archive of the repository contents for the currently viewed plan, operating system, and architecture.
