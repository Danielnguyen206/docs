## Table Filter

If omitted or left empty, this section from the `.ini` file means that
LiveCompare executes against all tables in the first database.

If you want LiveCompare to execute against a specific set of tables, there
are different ways to specify this:

### `publications`
You can filter specific publications, and LiveCompare uses
    only the tables associated with those publications. You can use the variable
    `publication_name` to build the conditional expression, for example:

```ini
publications = publication_name = 'livepub'
```

Requires `logical_replication_mode = native`.

### `replication_sets`
When using pglogical or PGD, you can filter specific
    replication sets, and LiveCompare works only on the tables associated with
    those replication sets. You can use the variable `set_name` to build the
    conditional expression, for example:

```ini
replication_sets = set_name in ('default', 'bdrgroup')
```

Requires `logical_replication_mode = pglogical` or
`logical_replication_mode = bdr`.

### `schemas`
You can filter specific schemas, and LiveCompare works only on
    the tables that belong to those schemas. You can use the variable `schema_name`
    to build the conditional expression, for example:

```ini
schemas = schema_name != 'badschema'
```

### `tables`
The variable `table_name` can help you build a conditional
    expression to filter only the tables you want LiveCompare to work on, for
    example:

```ini
tables = table_name not like '%%account'
```

In any conditional expression, escape the `%` character as `%%`.

The table name must be schema-qualified, unless `schema_qualified_table_names`
is disabled. For example, you can filter only a specific list of
tables:

```
tables = table_name in ('myschema1.mytable1', 'myschema2.mytable2')
```

If you disable the general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
must also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO myschema1, myschema2

[Table Filter]
tables = table_name in ('mytable1', 'mytable2')
```

!!! Important
    If two or more schemas that were set on `search_path` contain a table with the same name, just the first one found is considered in the comparison.

The `Table Filter` section can have a mix of `publications`, `replication_sets`,
`schemas`, and `tables` filters. LiveCompare considers the set of tables
that are in the intersection of all filters you specified. For example:

```ini
[Table Filter]
publications = publication_name = 'livepub'
replication_sets = set_name in ('default', 'bdrgroup')
schemas = schema_name != 'badschema'
tables = table_name not like '%%account'
```

The table filter is applied in the first database to
build the table list. If a table exists in the first database and is being
considered in the filter, but it doesn't exist in any other database, then you
something like this is added to the logs, and the comparison for that specific
table is skipped:

```text
2019-06-17 11:52:41,403 - ERROR - live_table.py - 55 - GetMetaData - P1: livecompare_second_1: Table public.test does not exist
2019-06-17 11:52:41,410 - ERROR - live_round.py - 201 - Initialize - P1: Table public.test does not exist on second connection. Aborting comparison
```

Similarly, if a table exists in any other database but doesn't exist in the
first database, then it isn't considered in the comparison, even if you
didn't apply any table filter.

A comparison for a specific table is also skipped if the table column names
aren't exactly the same (unless `column_intersection` is enabled), and in the
same order. An appropriate message is added to the log file as well.

Currently LiveCompare doesn't check if data types or constraints are the same
on both tables.

!!! Important
    `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of the table filter.

## Row Filter

In this section, you can apply a row-level filter to any table, so LiveCompare
works only on the rows that satisfy the row filter.

You can write a list of tables under this section, one table per line. All
table names must be schema qualified unless `schema_qualified_table_names` is
disabled. For example:

```ini
[Row Filter]
public.table1 = id = 10
public.table2 = logdate >= '2000-01-01'
```

In this case, for the table `public.table1`, LiveCompare works only in the
rows that satisfy the clause `id = 10`. For the table `public.table2`,
only rows that satisfy `logdate >= '2000-01-01` are considered in the
comparison.

If you disable the general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
must also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO public

[Row Filter]
table1 = id = 10
table2 = logdate >= '2000-01-01'
```

Any kind of SQL condition (same as you put in the `WHERE` clause) is
accepted in the same line as the table row filter. For example, if you have a
large table and want to compare only a specific number of IDs, you can
create a temporary table with all the IDs. Then you can use an `IN` clause to
emulate a `JOIN`, like this:  

```
[Row Filter]
public.large_table = id IN (SELECT id2 FROM temp_table)
```

If a row filter is written incorrectly, then LiveCompare tries to apply the
filter but fails. So the comparison for this specific table is skipped,
and an exception is written to the log file.

If a table is listed in the `Row Filter` section but somehow got filtered out
by the `Table Filter`, then the row filter for this table is silently
ignored.

!!! Important
    `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of the row filter.

### Using current timestamp in Row Filter

The `Row Filter` is applied differently depending on the `data_fetch_mode`:

-   On Postgres, setting `data_fetch_mode` to `server_side_cursors_with_hold` or
    `server_side_cursors_without_hold` causes the `Row Filter` to be applied
    only at the beginning of the table comparison, when the query is executed. This
    means that using a server-side cursor to fetch data ensures the data is seen as
    a snapshot of how it was beginning of the comparison.
-   On Postgres, setting `data_fetch_mode` to `prepared_statements` (the default)
    includes the `Row Filter` in the prepared query, which is then
    executed at every data buffer that's fetched. This means that, if the query
    uses `now()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, or `SYSDATE` (on EDB Postgres Advanced Server) on the `Row Filter`,
    then when the prepared statement executes, Postgres reevaluates the
    current timestamp.

So, suppose you're using `now()`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, or `SYSDATE` on the `Row Filter`,
for example:

```
[Row Filter]
public.table3 = logdate < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
```

In this case, you must also use a server-side cursor to ensure the current
timestamp is evaluated only at the beginning of the queries. In other words,
`data_fetch_mode` must be set to a value different from
`prepared_statements`.

On Oracle, the `data_fetch_mode` setting is ignored, and
the query is executed at the beginning. Then data is fetched by way of the client-side
cursor. This approach ensures data is seen as a snapshot of how it was at the beginning
of the comparison. This is a client-side cursor, but the behavior is similar to
using a server-side cursor in Postgres.

## Column Filter

In this section, you can apply a column-level filter to any table, so LiveCompare
works only on the columns that aren't part of the column filter.

You can write a list of tables under this section, one table per line. All
table names must be schema qualified unless `schema_qualified_table_names` is
disabled. For example, suppose that both `public.table1` and `public.table2` have
the columns `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, `column4`, and `column5`:

```ini
[Column Filter]
public.table1 = column1, column3
public.table2 = column1, column5
```

In this case, for the table `public.table1`, LiveCompare works only in the
columns `column2`, `column4`, and `column5`, filtering out `column1` and `column3`.
For the table `public.table2`, only the columns `column2`, `column3`, and
`column4` are considered in the comparison, filtering out `column1` and `column5`.

If you disable the general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
must also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO public

[Column Filter]
table1 = column1, column3
table2 = column1, column5
```

If absent column names are given in the column filter, that is, the column doesn't
exist in the given table, then LiveCompare logs a message about the missing columns
and ignores them. It uses just the valid ones, if any.

If a table is listed in the `Column Filter` section but somehow got filtered
out by the `Table Filter`, then the column filter for this table is
silently ignored.

!!! Important
    If a column specified in a `Column Filter` is part of the table PK, then it isn't ignored in the comparison. LiveCompare logs that and ignores the filter of such a column.

!!! Important
    `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of the column filter.

## Comparison Key

!!! Tip "New feature"
   LiveCompare comparison key support is available in LiveCompare version 2.0 and later.
!!!

Similar to the `Column Filter`, in this section you can also specify a list
of columns per table. These columns are considered as a comparison key for
the specific table, even if the table has a primary key or `UNIQUE` constraint.

For example:

```ini
[Comparison Key]
public.table1 = col_a, col_b
public.table2 = c1, c2
```

In this example, for table `public.table1`, the comparison key is
columns `col_a` and `col_b`. For table `public.table2`, columns `c1` and `c2` are
considered as a comparison key.

The same behavior about missing columns or filtered out or missing tables that
are explained in [Column Filter](#column-filter), also apply to the comparison
key. Similarly, the `Comparison Key` section is ignored in `conflicts` mode.

## Conflicts Filter

In this section, you can specify a filter to use in `--conflicts` mode while
fetching conflicts from PGD nodes. You can build any SQL conditional expression
and use these fields in the expression:

-   `origin_node`: The upstream node of the subscription.
-   `target_node`: The downstream node of the subscription.
-   `local_time`: The timestamp when the conflict occurred in the node.
-   `conflict_type`: The type of conflict.
-   `conflict_resolution`: The resolution that was applied.
-   `nspname`: Schema name of the involved relation.
-   `relname`: Relation name of the involved relation.

You must use the `conflicts` attribute under the section. For example:

```
[Conflicts Filter]
conflicts = conflict_type = 'update_missing' AND nspname = 'my_schema'
```

If you add this piece of configuration to your `.ini` file, LiveCompare fetches
only conflicts that are of type `update_missing` and related to tables under
the schema `my_schema` while querying for conflicts in each of the PGD nodes.

!!! Important
    This section is exclusively for `--conflicts` mode.
