<h4>EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) authenticated file read permissions bypass using edbldr</h4>
<h5> All versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) edbldr from 15.0 and prior to 15.7.0 and from 16.0 and prior to 16.3.0</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
All versions of EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) from 15.0 and prior to 15.7.0 and from 16.0 and prior to 16.3.0 may allow users using <code>edbldr</code> to bypass role permissions from <code>pg_read_server_files</code>. This could allow low privilege users to read files to which they would not otherwise have access.

<h4>PostgreSQL relation replacement during pg_dump executes arbitrary SQL</h4>
<h5> All versions of PostgreSQL, EPAS and PGE prior to 16.4, 15.8, and 14.13</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the user running pg_dump, which is often a superuser. The attack involves replacing another relation type with a view or foreign table. The attack requires waiting for pg_dump to start, but winning the race condition is trivial if the attacker retains an open transaction. Versions before PostgreSQL 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, and 12.20 are affected.

<span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="assessments/edb-2024-003">Read Assessment</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Updated: </span><span>2024/05/09</span>
<h4>Restrict visibility of "pg_stats_ext" and "pg_stats_ext_exprs" entries to the table owner</h4>
<h5> All versions of PostgreSQL, EPAS and PGE prior to 16.3, 15.7, and 14.12</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Missing authorization in PostgreSQL built-in views pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs allows an unprivileged database user to read most common values and other statistics from CREATE STATISTICS commands of other users. The most common values may reveal column values the eavesdropper could not otherwise read or results of functions they cannot execute. Installing an unaffected version only fixes fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with the initdb utility after installing that version. Current PostgreSQL installations will remain vulnerable until they follow the instructions in the release notes, which are provided as a convenience in the below section. Within major versions 14-16, minor versions before PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, and 14.12 are affected. Versions before PostgreSQL 14 are unaffected.
