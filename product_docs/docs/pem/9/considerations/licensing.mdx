To use PEM, you must have an EDB Standard or Enterprise subscription.

Any Postgres servers you monitor using PEM (whether by installing the
PEM Agent locally, through Remote Monitoring, or by making a client
connection from the PEM web application) must be covered by an EDB
Standard or Enterprise subscription.

Non-Postgres servers (for example PGD Proxy nodes)

The Postgres instance used as the PEM backend does not consume cores
from your subscription. Likewise, no cores are consumed by any other PEM
components. Nevertheless, all these components are covered by your
support agreement.

## Examples

### Adding PEM
A customer with an Enterprise subscription for 32 cores has 8 x 4-core
servers running EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS), thereby fully
consuming their 32 cores. This customer may install PEM on a fifth
server and use it to monitor their 8 EPAS servers. This requires no
change to their subscription as the PEM server does not consume cores
and the monitored EPAS instances are already fully covered. 

### Unsupported monitored servers
A customer with a Standard subscription for 36 cores has PEM and 6 x
6-core servers running PostgreSQL covered by EDB support - thereby
consuming their 36 cores as in the example above.

The customer also has 10 x 2-core PostgreSQL servers that are not
covered by any EDB subscription. These servers must not be monitored by
PEM as they are not covered by a Standard or Enterprise subscription. If the customer wishes to monitor these servers they must add a further 20 cores to their subscription.

!!! Note
A Community 360 subscription for the additional 20 cores is not sufficient. Servers monitored by PEM must
