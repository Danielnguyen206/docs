| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Added PGD extension details in the Core usage report.                                                                                                                                       |
| Enhancement  | If max_connections is set to 1 in the `agent.cfg` file, PEM agent startup process makes it to 2 in the backend code to avoid PEM's probe data collection failure. [Support ticket: #101924] |
| Enhancement  | Probes are now re-run on restart of agent and monitored server.                                                                                                                             |
| Enhancement  | Introduced v12 REST API to fix the API schema for alerts (GET) and alert templates (GET/PUT/POST).                                                                                          |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where the version information was missing in the `pemworker` utility usage.                                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with `reminder_notification_interval` setting. Now you can configure this parameter to a value less than 1 hour.                                                             |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue for webhook notification settings while copying the alerts. Now the webhook notification settings are copied while copying the alerts.                                       |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with the mismatched version label in REST API version 11.                                                                                                                    |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with the PGD alerts. Now disabling the PGD probes disables the PGD alerts as well.                                                                                           |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue while changing the Job type from Batch to SQL and vice-versa. Now it allows to change the job type from Batch to SQL and vice-versa without any errors.                      |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Updated the Servers Down and Agents Down alert template by adding detailed information in the SQL.                                                                                          |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Updated the help text of the alert script execution. The help text now says that the scrip execution code must be in batch/shell format and not in SQL.                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with the `current_pid`. Now the `current_pid` is not null even if the `agent_id` is null in the `probe_schedule` table.                                                      |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with messages for SQL profiler permission errors.                                                                                                                            |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with the `user_info` probe to get the exact password expiry date.                                                                                                            |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with the ServerHeartbeat. The ServerHeartbeat is released once DB server is deleted from PEM UI.                                                                             |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue with capacity manager. The capacity manager's option `report type` now automatically selects HTML when `New Tab` and `Previous Tab` are selected.                            |
