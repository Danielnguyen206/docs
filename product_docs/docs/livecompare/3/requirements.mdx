## Platform requirements

LiveCompare requires either:

* an x86 platform with Debian 11+, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, SLES 12 SP5 and 15 SP3, or CentOS/RHEL/RockyLinux/AlmaLinux 8/9+
* an IBM Power ppc64le platform with RHEL 8+ or SLES 12 SP5/15 SP3+
* an ARM64 platform with Debian 12+.

LiveCompare also requires:

-   Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10

LiveCompare installs on top of the latest Python version for Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS/RHEL 8, as provided by the `python3` packages.

On CentOS/RHEL distributions, LiveCompare also requires the EPEL repository. For details, see the [EPEL webpage](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).

## Database requirements

LiveCompare supports the following databases:

-   PostgreSQL / EDB Postgres Extended 9.5+ / EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11+ (on the output connection)
-   PostgreSQL / EDB Postgres Extended 9.4+ / EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11+ or Oracle 11g+ (on the data connections being compared)

LiveCompare only supports the use of LiveCompare with older versions of Postgres (PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended, or EDB Postgres Advanced Server) that have reached end of life in support of performing a major version upgrade to a newer supported version of Postgres.

!!! Note
EDB no longer tests LiveCompare with Oracle 10g. As such, it's no longer on the list of Oracle versions officially supported with LiveCompare. Oracle 10g was previously supported and is expected to continue to work in most cases. However, some limitations may exist.
!!!

## Installation

You can install LiveCompare from the EnterpriseDB `products/livecompare` repository. For details, see the [EDB customer portal](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/customer_portal/sw/livecompare/).





## LiveCompare with TPAexec

You can use the following sample config for [TPA (Trusted Postgres Architect)](/tpa/latest/) to build a server with `LiveCompare` and `PostgreSQL 13`:

```yaml
---
architecture: M1
cluster_name: livecompare_m1
cluster_tags: {}

cluster_vars:
  postgres_coredump_filter: '0xff'
  postgres_version: '13'
  postgresql_flavour: postgresql
  repmgr_failover: manual
  edb_repositories:
  - enterprise
  packages:
    common:
    - edb-livecompare
  use_volatile_subscriptions: true

locations:
- Name: main

instance_defaults:
  image: tpa/rocky
  platform: docker
  vars:
    ansible_user: root

instances:
- Name: livem1node1
  location: main
  node: 1
  role: primary
  published_ports:
    - 5401:5432
- Name: livem1node2
  location: main
  node: 2
  role: replica
  upstream: livem1node1
  published_ports:
    - 5402:5432

```
